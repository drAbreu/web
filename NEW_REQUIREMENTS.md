1. We are going to modify this webpage.
2. We are going to keep it within gh pages if it is possible but we will tweak it to make it look better and modern.
3. I would like to have a best off a one pager like this one: https://brittanychiang.com/ (seems to be a react page) and a personal / blog similar to what we currently have: https://www.jeremyjordan.me/tag/materials-science/, another possibility is this blog here: https://www.orestisgeorgiou.com/

4. This webpage will have:
   1. Featured Research
   2. Projects
      1. My Astronomy projects
      2. Morgenrot
      3. AI
      4. Science Outreach
    Recommended reads
   3. CV
   4. Social media links
   5. Links to oficial repositories

So the idea here is that I will have my professional AI research, but also a personal psychology related project, Morgenrot, that will have a book associated "El Sendero Morgenrot", currently reviewed by editors.
The Astronomy and Science Outreach parts could go together. One is my amateur astronomy path. How, doing amateur astronomy, you can also have some nice projects: Tracking Sunsputs, Moon cartography, cloud evolutin in planets...

All of this can be done, on a first step, using the `Tangerine`, `Sunset Horizon`, or `Amber Minimal` Themes to begin.

The code should allow me to easily load `markdown` files to increase content in the different projects and blogs.

Since this will be a blog like and personal web, I want it to be mainly easier to read. We do not need a lot of fancy components. We want a webpage that allows visitors to easily navigate through it and find the information needed, may it be the blogs, diaries, book, or professional publications.
