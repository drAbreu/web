I am a distinguished researcher with a PhD *cum laude* from the [Max Planck Institute for Astronomy](http://www.mpia.de/en) and the [University of Heidelberg](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/en), with a Thesis titled ["Molecular cloud structure at Galactic scales"](https://www.imprs-hd.mpg.de/143498/thesis_abreu.pdf). After five successful years as a Data Science and AI consultant in industry, I embraced the path back to my beloved scientific research at the [European Molecular Biology Organization, EMBO](https://www.embo.org/) and [European Life Sciences Laboratory, EMBL](https://www.embl.org/sites/heidelberg/) as a Machine Learning and AI Developer. <font color=#df6919><strong>I do cutting-edge research focusing on natural language processing (NLP), large language models (LLMs), multi-modal learning, and the generation and analysis of knowledge graphs. My scientific field of interest is primary molecular and cell biology</strong></font>, although I ocasionally look back to the application of the developed techniques to astronomy.

I am part of the [*EMBO Open Science Implementation Group*](https://www.embo.org/policy/open-science/), led by Dr. Thomas Lemberger. <font color=#df6919><strong>Our goal is to revolutionize scientific research by promoting open science tools and methodologies, helping researchers to fill the knowledge gap generated by the current huge scientific productivity.</strong></font> <font color=#4c9be8><strong>We stand for transparent and accessible research, aiming for a more collaborative and innovative research landscape.</strong></font> 

Having shifted my focus from astronomy to the biomedical field, I seek to contribute unraveling the mysteries of life. <font color=#4c9be8><strong>My career has shifted from understanding the universe to, with my expertise in AI, understanding the ultimate wonder of our cosmos: life itself</strong></font>. This transition reflects my insatiable curiosity and dedication to making transformative discoveries in the pursuit of advancing human knowledge.
