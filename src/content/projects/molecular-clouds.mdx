# Molecular Clouds at Galactic Scales: Understanding Star Formation

## PhD Thesis

**Institution:** Max Planck Institute for Astronomy & University of Heidelberg  
**Degree:** PhD in Astrophysics, *Summa Cum Laude*  
**Year:** 2017  
**Supervisor:** Prof. Dr. Henrik Beuther

## Abstract

Stars are born in molecular clouds - vast regions of cold gas and dust in galaxies. Understanding the structure and dynamics of these clouds is fundamental to understanding star formation, galaxy evolution, and ultimately, the origin of planetary systems like our own.

This thesis investigates molecular cloud structure across different scales, from individual star-forming regions to entire galaxies, using multi-wavelength observations and advanced statistical methods.

## Research Questions

### Primary Questions

1. **What determines the structure of molecular clouds?**
   - Turbulence vs. gravity
   - Magnetic fields
   - External pressure

2. **How do clouds fragment into stars?**
   - Hierarchical fragmentation
   - Mass distribution (IMF)
   - Efficiency of star formation

3. **What triggers star formation?**
   - Spiral arm compression
   - Cloud-cloud collisions
   - Feedback from existing stars

4. **How does environment affect cloud properties?**
   - Galactic center vs. disk
   - High vs. low pressure regions
   - Different galaxy types

## Methodology

### Observational Data

**Herschel Space Observatory:**
- Far-infrared imaging (70-500 μm)
- Maps of dust temperature and column density
- Unprecedented resolution and sensitivity

**Ground-Based Telescopes:**
- IRAM 30m (CO line observations)
- APEX (submillimeter continuum)
- VLT (optical/near-IR)

**Coverage:**
- 10+ nearby galaxies
- Milky Way star-forming regions
- Total mapped area: 100+ square degrees

### Analysis Techniques

**1. Filament Identification**
```python
# Custom algorithm for detecting filaments
filaments = identify_filaments(
    column_density_map,
    threshold=3.0,  # 3σ above background
    min_length=0.5 * pc
)
```

**2. Clump Extraction**
- Watershed algorithm for hierarchical structure
- Multi-scale decomposition
- Physical property measurement

**3. Statistical Analysis**
- Power spectrum analysis
- Mass distribution functions
- Structure function analysis

## Key Findings

### 1. Universal Filamentary Structure

**Discovery:** Molecular clouds across all environments show filamentary structure.

**Implications:**
- Filaments are the "skeleton" of clouds
- Stars form preferentially in filament intersections
- Suggests universal fragmentation mechanism

**Published in:** *Astronomy & Astrophysics* (2016)

### 2. The Role of Turbulence

**Discovery:** Turbulent energy injection scales with cloud mass and environment.

**Key Result:**
```
E_turbulent ∝ M^(1.1±0.1) * P_external^(0.3±0.1)
```

**Implications:**
- Turbulence supports clouds against collapse
- Environment (pressure) modulates star formation efficiency
- Explains observed scatter in star formation relations

### 3. Triggered Star Formation

**Discovery:** Evidence for triggered star formation at cloud edges near HII regions.

**Mechanism:**
1. Massive stars form
2. UV radiation creates expanding HII region
3. Compression triggers new star formation at edges
4. Sequential star formation propagates

**Observational Evidence:**
- Age gradients in stellar populations
- Enhanced star formation at edges
- Spatial correlation with HII regions

### 4. Galactic-Scale Structure

**Discovery:** Cloud properties vary systematically with galactic environment.

**Findings:**
- **Galactic center:** Higher pressure → denser clouds → more massive stars
- **Spiral arms:** Triggering by compression → bursts of star formation
- **Inter-arm regions:** Quieter, lower-mass star formation
