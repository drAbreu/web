# Scientific Knowledge Mapping: Connecting the Dots in Life Sciences

## Vision

Science is built on connections. Every discovery links to previous work, inspires new questions, and opens unexpected avenues. Yet, these connections often remain hidden in the silos of individual papers, databases, and researcher expertise.

**Scientific Knowledge Mapping** aims to make these connections visible, searchable, and actionable.

## The Challenge

### Information Fragmentation
Modern biological research is scattered across:
- 📄 **35+ million papers** in PubMed
- 🗄️ **Hundreds of databases** (UniProt, KEGG, GO, etc.)
- 🧪 **Proprietary datasets** in labs
- 🧠 **Tacit knowledge** in researchers' minds

### The Cost
- Duplicate experiments
- Missed connections
- Slow hypothesis generation
- Research waste

## Our Approach

### Knowledge Graph Technology

Transform unstructured scientific text into structured, queryable knowledge:

```
Text: "Protein X inhibits pathway Y in cancer cells"
       ↓
Graph: (Protein X)-[INHIBITS]→(Pathway Y)-[ACTIVE_IN]→(Cancer)
```

### Architecture

1. **Data Integration**
   - Ingest from multiple sources
   - Normalize entity identifiers
   - Resolve conflicts
   - Maintain provenance

2. **Graph Construction**
   - Entities as nodes (genes, proteins, diseases, chemicals)
   - Relationships as edges (activates, inhibits, causes)
   - Properties store metadata (confidence, publication, date)

3. **Semantic Layer**
   - Vector embeddings for similarity search
   - Ontology alignment (GO, MeSH, ChEBI)
   - Inference rules for implicit connections

4. **Query Interface**
   - Cypher queries for graph traversal
   - Natural language queries via LLM
   - Visual exploration tools

### Technologies

**Graph Database:** Neo4j
- Optimized for relationship queries
- ACID transactions
- Scalable to billions of nodes

**Vector Store:** Pinecone / FAISS
- Semantic similarity search
- Fast nearest-neighbor retrieval

**Processing:** Python + Apache Spark
- Distributed processing of millions of papers
- Incremental updates

**Frontend:** React + D3.js
- Interactive graph visualization
- Zoom, pan, filter capabilities

## Use Cases

### 1. Drug Repurposing
**Query:** "Which approved drugs affect the same pathways as this target protein?"

**Result:** Discover existing drugs that could be repurposed for new indications.

**Impact:** Faster, cheaper drug development.

### 2. Literature-Based Discovery
**Query:** "What are the indirect connections between Disease A and Gene B?"

**Result:** Uncover hidden connections through intermediate concepts.

**Impact:** Novel hypothesis generation.

### 3. Research Trend Analysis
**Query:** "Show me emerging topics in immunotherapy over the last 5 years"

**Result:** Visual timeline of research evolution.

**Impact:** Strategic research planning.

### 4. Expert Finding
**Query:** "Who are the leading researchers at the intersection of X and Y?"

**Result:** Network of experts and their contributions.

**Impact:** Collaboration opportunities.

## The Graph

### Current Scale
- **Nodes:** 50 million+ entities
- **Edges:** 200 million+ relationships
- **Papers:** 1 million+ full-text articles
- **Update Frequency:** Weekly

### Entity Types
- Genes & Proteins
- Small Molecules & Drugs
- Diseases & Phenotypes
- Cell Types & Tissues
- Biological Processes
- Experimental Methods
- Organisms

### Relationship Types
- Activates / Inhibits
- Causes / Prevents
- Binds To
- Expressed In
- Associated With
- Part Of / Has Part

## Technical Details

### Graph Schema

```cypher
// Example: Gene-Disease relationship
(:Gene {id: "BRCA1", name: "Breast cancer type 1"})-
  [:ASSOCIATED_WITH {
    confidence: 0.98,
    source: "PMID:12345678",
    evidence: "Genetic study"
  }]->
(:Disease {id: "DOID:1612", name: "Breast cancer"})
```

### Query Examples

```cypher
// Find all proteins that interact with TP53
MATCH (p:Protein {name: "TP53"})-[r:INTERACTS_WITH]-(other:Protein)
RETURN other.name, r.confidence
ORDER BY r.confidence DESC
LIMIT 20

// Find shortest path between two concepts
MATCH path = shortestPath(
  (a:Gene {name: "BRCA1"})-[*..5]-(b:Disease {name: "Alzheimer's"})
)
RETURN path
```

### Vector Embeddings

```python
# Semantic similarity search
query = "immune response to viral infection"
similar_papers = vector_store.similarity_search(query, k=10)

# Cluster related concepts
embeddings = model.encode(entity_descriptions)
clusters = kmeans(embeddings, n_clusters=50)
```
