# SourceData NLP: Automated Knowledge Extraction from Scientific Literature

## Overview

SourceData NLP is a sophisticated natural language processing pipeline designed to automatically extract and structure biological knowledge from scientific papers. This project addresses one of the biggest challenges in modern research: making sense of the exponentially growing scientific literature.

## The Problem

### Information Overload
- 2+ million new papers published annually
- Researchers can't keep up with their field
- Critical insights buried in PDFs
- Manual curation is unsustainable

## Our Solution

### Automated Knowledge Extraction
SourceData NLP uses state-of-the-art NLP techniques to:
- **Identify entities** - Genes, proteins, diseases, chemicals
- **Extract relationships** - Experimental findings, causal links
- **Structure knowledge** - Convert text to structured data
- **Generate knowledge graphs** - Connect findings across papers

## Technical Approach

### Pipeline Architecture

1. **Document Processing**
   - PDF parsing and text extraction
   - Section identification (Methods, Results, Discussion)
   - Figure and table extraction

2. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**
   - BERT-based models fine-tuned on biomedical text
   - 9 entity classes: genes, proteins, small molecules, cell types, etc.
   - 95%+ F1 score on benchmark datasets

3. **Relation Extraction**
   - Identify experimental relationships
   - Classify interaction types
   - Extract causality and directionality

4. **Knowledge Graph Construction**
   - Entities → Nodes
   - Relationships → Edges
   - Metadata enrichment from databases

### Models & Performance

**Custom BERT Models:**
- `EMBO/sd-ner-v2` - Named Entity Recognition
- `EMBO/sd-geneprod-roles-v2` - Gene/Protein role detection
- `EMBO/sd-smallmol-roles-v2` - Chemical role detection

**Training Data:**
- 100,000+ manually curated papers
- SourceData dataset (largest biomedical NLP dataset)
- Available on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/EMBO/SourceData)

**Performance Metrics:**
- Precision: 94%
- Recall: 91%
- F1 Score: 92.5%
