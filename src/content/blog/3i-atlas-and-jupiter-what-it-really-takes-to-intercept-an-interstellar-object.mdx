# 3I/ATLAS and Jupiter: What It Really Takes to Intercept an Interstellar Object (II)

Why orbital mechanics, thermodynamics, and the rocket equation make an intentional Jupiter rendezvous physically impossible at 75 km/s

A recent preprint by Hibberd, Loeb, and Siraj (arXiv:2507.12213) examines 3I/ATLAS's close approach to Jupiter in March 2026. The paper makes an intriguing observation: the object's closest approach distance to Jupiter (53.6 million km) appears to nearly match Jupiter's Hill radius (53.5 million km), leading to speculation about whether this could represent an intentional rendezvous by an alien probe.

Rather than debate the interpretation, I'd like to use 3I/ATLAS as a case study to explore some fascinating physics. What would it actually take, from an engineering and physics standpoint, to rendezvous with Jupiter coming in from interstellar space? The answer involves orbital mechanics, propulsion limits, and some truly extreme atmospheric entry conditions.

## Part 1: The Evolving Hill Radius Match

The paper's original version noted that 3I/ATLAS would pass at a distance "identical to" Jupiter's Hill radius, with a probability of P=0.00004 for such a precise match. This formed a key part of the argument for intentional guidance.

However, as more observational data accumulated, the orbital estimates refined, the claim changed from "identical to" to "close to". The perijove estimate shifted from 53.445M km to 53.6M km.

This evolution is completely normal in astronomy. Here's how preliminary orbital estimates typically converge as observations improve:

![Simulated evolution of orbital uncertainty for 3I/ATLAS](/blog/3iatlas_jupiter/figure_1.webp)
*Figure 1: Simulated evolution of orbital uncertainty for 3I/ATLAS. As observations accumulate after discovery, the uncertainty (blue shaded region) shrinks and the best-fit value converges. Early estimates can differ from final values by several percent — normal for orbital determination.*

The key insight: what looked like a "perfect match" with limited early data became "close to" as the measurements improved. This isn't anyone's error. It's simply how science works with evolving data.

### But Is It Even Special?

Even if 3I/ATLAS did pass exactly at the Hill radius, would that be remarkable? Jupiter has many gravitationally significant radii:

![Jupiter's gravitational sphere of influence](/blog/3iatlas_jupiter/figure_2_main.webp)
*Figure 2: Jupiter's gravitational sphere of influence contains many special radii. The Hill radius is just one of eight shown here, spanning four orders of magnitude. Any hyperbolic flyby must cross all of them. Note that the orbits are depicted as circles for simplicity and that the 3I atlas trajectory shown is an example that most probably exaggerates the course change that Jupiter will generate in the comet.*

To test whether passing near the Hill radius is unusual, we can use a [Monte Carlo simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) (as in [the previous post](/blog/the-3i-atlas-alien-mothership-claim-a-statistical-reality-check)) generating random interstellar trajectories that pass by Jupiter.

But what are actually the important Jupiter orbital points? Jupiter has five Lagrange points. Special locations where gravitational forces balance:

| Point | Distance | Stability | Implication |
|-------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| L1 | 52M km | Unstable (saddle) | Can't park here |
| L2 | 54M km | Unstable (saddle) | Can't park here |
| Hill radius | 53.5M km | Not even an orbit | Just a boundary |
| L4 (Greeks) | 778M km | Stable | Could rendezvous here |
| L5 (Trojans) | 778M km | Stable | Could rendezvous here |

The simulation shows that most of the possible 3I ATLAS trajectories around Jupiter would at some point pass by the Hill radius. Even around 10% of them would basically hit the Hill radius at their closest orbital path to Jupiter. Hardly any evidence for anomaly can be found here.

However, I must acknowledge that this analysis is biased. As we increase the radius, more and more comets will pass, so the radial increase we see is not actually a big proof. Furthermore, to be fully precise, I should take only the trajectories that previously pass by Venus and Mars. So while this can give an idea, is not the full picture and therefore will not be stressed as in the previous article. I will add a more precise study if I get time to work on it. In any case, this does not take anything from the 4 takeaways shown below:

![Probability distribution of closest approaches to Jupiter](/blog/3iatlas_jupiter/figure_3.webp)
*Figure 3: Probability distribution of closest approaches to Jupiter for random interstellar trajectories. The Hill radius is not a special attractor — it's just one distance among many.*

**Key takeaways:**

1. L1, L2, and Hill radius show identical passage rates (~31–34%). Hill sphere gives an approximate region where a planet's gravity can dominate over the Sun, with L1 and L2 roughly in that ballpark but not exactly at the same distance. Results are pure geometry. Not evidence of targeting.
2. Stable rendezvous points (L4, L5) are 10× farther away. If 3I/ATLAS were designed to rendezvous with Jupiter's system, it would target L4 or L5 where it could remain indefinitely. Instead, it's passing through the unstable inner region.
3. The Hill radius isn't an orbit — it's just the outer boundary of Jupiter's gravitational dominance. You can't "rendezvous" there any more than you can rendezvous at the edge of Earth's atmosphere.
4. The stability is crucial: L1 and L2 are saddle points — any object at these locations is dynamically unstable and will drift away without constant correction. The Hill radius isn't even a potential orbit; it's just a distance where Jupiter's gravity becomes weaker than the Sun's. If an advanced civilization wanted to study Jupiter, they would target the stable L4 or L5 Trojan points at 778M km, where a spacecraft could remain indefinitely with minimal fuel. Instead, 3I/ATLAS is rushing through an unstable zone at enormous velocity. This is the trajectory of a natural comet in a gravitational flyby. It is not that of a probe executing a planned rendezvous.

But the interesting part comes below. Jupiter allows us to do quite some interesting calculations if we follow the "what if" scenario of "Would 3I/ATLAS be a mothership probe". For this reason, I thought that it could be really interesting to do a series of calculations and do some estimates to get an idea of how actually challenging would be, given the actual orbit of 3I ATLAS, to actually intercept or rendezvous with Jupiter.

**DISCLAIMER:** The calculations below fall under the back of the napkin numbers. These are fast easy estimates to have an idea of whether an hypothesis makes any sense. It is a kind of a first test every scientist does when a new hypothesis comes around. The numbers will therefore be not scientifically accurate. However, they will give an idea within order of magnitude, that can be used to draw some fair conclusions.

## Part 2: If It Were a Mission — What Would It Take?

### A Note on Calculations

I attempted to reproduce Loeb's paper trajectory calculations but obtained significantly different delta-V requirements than reported (~27 km/s vs. their ~5 km/s for the July 2025 window). After doing a deep analysis of the code used and trying to understand what they did on their paper, I could not find the reason of the differences between both calculations.

For this reason, rather than debate the methodology, let's assume their calculations are correct and explore what a ~2.7-5 km/s intercept mission would mean from an engineering perspective.

Even accepting their optimistic numbers, several fundamental problems emerge:

![Comparison of achieved spacecraft capabilities vs. 3I/ATLAS intercept requirements](/blog/3iatlas_jupiter/figure_4.webp)
*Figure 4: Comparison of achieved spacecraft capabilities vs. 3I/ATLAS intercept requirements. Even the optimistic 5 km/s estimate represents a significant challenge. Data has been obtained from multiple sources: The Dawn Ion Propulsion System, Deep Space 1 (Ion), Apollo CSM (This one is a bit problematic since there are different values that can be taken, but they are between the cited 2.8 km/s of the CSM and 11 km/s of the entire mission), New Horizons, Parker Solar Probe, Rendezvous and intercept data were specially calculated for this post and the intercept of Hibbard et al. is that from the paper of Loeb. The theoretical limit of the Advanced Ion Drive is calculated from the Tsiolkovsky Rocket Equation. It is therefore a theoretical value, yet to be empirically tested.*

A ~5 km/s intercept delta-V is quite at the edge of human capability. It's ambitious but possible with dedicated mission design. However, there's a crucial distinction we need to understand: intercept ≠ rendezvous.

## Part 3: The Intercept vs. Rendezvous Problem

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** The numbers from this point on should not be taken as Real or exhaustive calculations. These are intended to be back of the envelope calculations to proof a point. They are spot on qualitatively, but their quantitative actual values would require much more detailed and refined calculations. This is out of the scope of this article

### What's the Difference?

**Intercept (flyby):** Match positions at a specific time. The spacecraft and target occupy the same location, but their velocities can differ wildly. You fly past at high relative speed.

**Rendezvous (orbit matching):** Match both position and velocity. You arrive at the same place, at the same time, moving at the same speed and direction. This enables orbit insertion or extended observation.

The Hibberd, Loeb 2025 paper suggests that 3I/ATLAS could be "delivering probes to Jupiter's system," which requires rendezvous, matching Jupiter's orbital velocity to enter orbit or deploy instruments. However, their 5 km/s delta requirement explicitly claims intercept, and I think this is where the differences between their numbers and those on this post might be.

### The Rendezvous Energy Budget

I calculated the full rendezvous delta-V requirements using a high-precision [Lambert solver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambert%27s_problem) across all possible departure dates and flight times, given 3I ATLAS orbital elements. I will be happy if corrections to this calculation are shared.

![Porkchop plot showing total delta-V for both departure and Jupiter capture burns](/blog/3iatlas_jupiter/figure_5.webp)
*Figure 5: Porkchop plot showing total delta-V for both departure and Jupiter capture burns. The global minimum is 43.8 km/s — nearly 10× the intercept requirement.*

**Minimum total rendezvous delta-V: 43.8 km/s**

This includes:

- Departure burn from 3I/ATLAS trajectory: ~5–27 km/s (depending on timing)
- Jupiter capture burn (using [Oberth effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberth_effect) at 1.05 RJ): ~20–40 km/s

Even using the most efficient trajectory and optimal timing, you need almost ten times more energy to rendezvous than to simply intercept.

![Comparison between the energy budgets needed for Jupiter intercept and rendezvous maneuvers](/blog/3iatlas_jupiter/figure_6.webp)
*Figure 6: Comparison between the energy budgets needed for Jupiter intercept and rendezvous maneuvers.*

### The Mass Fraction Problem

The [Tsiolkovsky rocket equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation) tells us how much propellant we need:

Δv = Isp × g₀ × ln(m_initial / m_final)

Rearranging: mass ratio = exp(Δv / (Isp × g₀))

![Mass ratio requirements for different propulsion technologies](/blog/3iatlas_jupiter/figure_7.webp)
*Figure 7: Mass ratio requirements for different propulsion technologies. At 43.8 km/s, even advanced ion drives require enormous propellant fractions.*

For a 43.8 km/s rendezvous mission:

| Propulsion | Isp (sec) | Mass Ratio | Payload Fraction |
|------------|-----------|------------|------------------|
| Chemical (LOX/LH2) | 450 | 20,000× | 0.002% |
| Nuclear Thermal | 900 | 220× | 0.45% |
| Ion Drive (Hall) | 3000 | 4.4× | 22.7% |
| Fusion (Theoretical) | 10,000 | 1.6× | 62.5% |

What this means:

- **With chemical rockets:** To deliver 1 kg to Jupiter orbit requires launching 20 tonnes from 3I/ATLAS
- **With ion drives:** To deliver 1 kg requires 4.4 kg total mass
- **With theoretical fusion rockets:** You could manage 1.6× mass ratio

Even a tiny 0.1 kg probe requires:

- **Chemical:** 4,800 kg total (impossible. It is even larger than the "mothership")
- **Ion:** 0.44 kg propellant (but remember, the mothership needs to carry this for every probe)

The probe deployment scenario breaks down: If 3I/ATLAS deployed small probes, those probes would inherit the mothership's 65+ km/s velocity relative to Jupiter. Each probe would need its own 43.8+ km/s propulsion system for rendezvous and 5–20 kms for flyby. The rocket equation applies regardless of size.

## Part 4: The Aerocapture Alternative

Perhaps instead of propulsive braking, could 3I/ATLAS use Jupiter's atmosphere to slow down? This technique, aerocapture, has been studied for Mars and Venus missions (e.g., here, here). Could it work at Jupiter for 3I/ATLAS?

### Entry Conditions

Relative velocity at Jupiter's atmosphere:

- 3I/ATLAS velocity: ~65 km/s (interstellar)
- Jupiter's orbital velocity: ~13 km/s
- Accounting for Jupiter's rotation and gravity: **~75.6 km/s entry speed**

### The Aerocapture Impossibility

Recent observations from the Green Bank Telescope and JWST confirm 3I/ATLAS has:

- Diameter: ~1 km (820–1,050 m)
- Mass: ~4.4×10¹⁰ kg (44 million tonnes)
- Density: ~500 kg/m³ (typical comet)

This creates an impossible trade-off: where heating is manageable, there's insufficient deceleration. Where deceleration is adequate, heating is catastrophic.

### Scenario 1: Upper Atmosphere (900 km altitude)

**Atmospheric density:** ρ = 10⁻⁴ kg/m³

**Heating Analysis:** Stagnation point heating scales as: q ∝ √ρ × v³

(Technical note: This is the Sutton-Graves equation for convective heating. At 75 km/s, radiative heating dominates, and these would scale with v⁸-v¹², strengthening even more the arguments here provided.)

3I/ATLAS vs. Apollo:

- Density ratio: √(10⁻⁴/10⁻²) = 0.1×
- Velocity ratio: (75.6/11)³ = 325×
- Combined: ~40× Apollo's peak heating
- **Peak heating rate: ~400 MW/m²**

For context, Apollo's heat shield handled ~10 MW/m². The Galileo probe — specifically designed to survive Jupiter entry — experienced ~300 MW/m² and was heavily armored for a one-way mission.

This is challenging but perhaps survivable with advanced materials.

**Deceleration Analysis**

Using drag force: F = ½ρv²A

- Cross-sectional area: A = π(500 m)² = 785,398 m²
- F_drag = ½ × 10⁻⁴ × (75,600)² × 785,398 = 2.24×10¹¹ N
- Acceleration: a = F/m = 2.24×10¹¹ / 4.4×10¹⁰ = 5.1 m/s²
- **Peak deceleration: 0.5 g**

This is completely insufficient to capture into orbit.

### Scenario 2: Mid Atmosphere (500 km altitude)

**Atmospheric density:** ρ = 0.01 kg/m³ (100× denser)

**Heating:**

- Heating scales as √ρ × v³
- Increase: √100 = 10×
- **New heating: 400 × 10 = 4,000 MW/m²**

This is 400× Apollo and 13× Galileo. No material can survive this.

**Deceleration:**

- F_drag increases by 100×
- Acceleration: 510 m/s²
- **Peak deceleration: 52 g**

This would be adequate for capture. However, there is a gotcha here.

### Scenario 3: Lower Atmosphere (300 km altitude)

**Atmospheric density:** ρ = 0.1 kg/m³ (1000× denser than upper)

**Heating:**

- Increase: √1000 ≈ 32×
- **New heating: 400 × 32 = 12,800 MW/m²**

This is 1,280× Apollo. The object becomes a plasma fireball.

**Deceleration:**

- F_drag increases by 1000×
- **Peak deceleration: 520 g**

### Energy Dissipation

The total kinetic energy that must be dissipated:

KE = ½mv² = ½ × (4.4×10¹⁰ kg) × (75,600 m/s)² = 1.26×10²⁰ Joules

This is equivalent to:

- 2,000,000× the Hiroshima atomic bomb (not 53×!)
- 870× all Space Shuttle reentries combined
- Average power dissipation (if over 1 minute): 2.1 Petawatts (1,750× total US electrical capacity)

### The Fundamental Problem

Let us summarize the results calculated above:

| Altitude | Density | Heating | Deceleration | Outcome |
|----------|---------|---------|--------------|---------|
| 900 km | 10⁻⁴ kg/m³ | 40× Apollo | 0.5 g | ❌ Can't capture |
| 500 km | 0.01 kg/m³ | 4,000× Apollo | 52 g | ❌ Vaporizes |
| 300 km | 0.1 kg/m³ | 12,800× Apollo | 520 g | ❌ Instant plasma |

There is no altitude where both heating and deceleration are acceptable.

Where heating is survivable, there's insufficient drag to capture. Where there's sufficient drag, the heating is catastrophic. This isn't an engineering challenge — it's a fundamental physical constraint.

### Material Limits

Even the most advanced materials have limits:

- Carbon-carbon composite (Space Shuttle nose): Max ~1,650°C, ~50 MW/m²
- PICA-X (SpaceX Dragon): Max ~3,000°C, ~100 MW/m²
- Galileo heat shield (ablative): Max ~15,000°C, ~300 MW/m²

At 4,000–12,800 MW/m², you exceed the sublimation temperature of all known materials. The object doesn't just burn — it transitions directly from solid to plasma.

The hypothesis that 3I/ATLAS could use aerocapture to enter Jupiter's system faces insurmountable physics:

1. **Energy scale:** Must dissipate 2 million Hiroshima bombs worth of energy
2. **No sweet spot:** Can't find an altitude with both manageable heating and adequate deceleration
3. **Material limits:** Heating rates exceed sublimation temperatures of all known substances

This isn't about advanced technology. These are fundamental thermodynamic and material science limits that apply to any civilization, regardless of technological advancement.

## Conclusions

What we learned about 3I/ATLAS:

1. **The Hill radius "match" evolved:** Early data suggested a precise alignment; improved data showed it was approximate. This is normal orbital determination.
2. **Statistical significance is questionable:** Monte Carlo simulations show ~10% of random interstellar trajectories through Jupiter following the entry of 3I ATLAS in our system would pass within ±10% of the Hill radius. Not rare enough to invoke special explanations.
3. **Intercept is hard; rendezvous is harder:** Even accepting optimistic intercept estimates (~5 km/s), actual rendezvous requires ~43.8 km/s — nearly 10× more energy.
4. **Aerocapture is physically impossible:** At 75.6 km/s entry velocity, the heating, energy dissipation (2M× Hiroshima), and decelerations would either be not enough for capturing orbit or extreme enough to completely disintegrate 3I/ATLAS.
5. **The mother ship does not work:** Smaller probes would inherit the orbital speed of the mother ship and would still need to overcome the extreme velocity changes needed to do a Jupiter rendezvous or intercept maneuver.

The hypothesis that 3I/ATLAS represents an alien probe intentionally rendezvous-ing with Jupiter faces severe physics constraints that no amount of advanced technology can overcome. Some limits are fundamental. Not engineering challenges but walls built into the structure of physics itself.

### What this doesn't mean:

This is not an argument against:

- Searching for technosignatures (which remains scientifically valuable)
- Studying interstellar objects closely (we should study them all!)
- Considering unusual hypotheses (when warranted by evidence)

Rather, it's a reminder that physics provides essential reality checks. When evaluating extraordinary claims, we must ask: "Does this respect fundamental constraints like conservation of energy, material limits, and statistical baselines?"
