# Notes on 3I/ATLAS and Scientific Discourse

## Scientific Analysis vs. Popular Opinion

    - A few reporters asked me today about the strong statements made by the science popularizer Brian Cox who argued forcefully that 3I/ATLAS is definitely a natural comet. I explained that Brian Cox did not write a single scientific paper about 3I/ATLAS.

    - This brings us to an anecdote from another event that took place today. As director of Harvard’s Institute for Theory and Computation, I lead every Thursday a luncheon attended by over a hundred astrophysicists. The event features four presentations on the latest advances in astrophysics. One of today’s presentations focused on the discrepancy between the current expansion rate of the Universe and the value expected for it based on the cosmic microwave background, the relic radiation from the hot dense matter in the first 400,000 years of cosmic history after the Big Bang. It appears very difficult to explain this anomaly in the data in terms of an elegant theoretical model. At the conclusion of the presentation which demonstrated beyond any statistical uncertainty that the discrepancy is real, I pointed out to all the young theorists in the audience: “It is a bad professional practice for theoretical astrophysicists to conclude that the data must be wrong just because they do not have a theoretical explanation for it.” Needless to say, the same lesson applies to the anomalies of 3I/ATLAS.
