# Science is Not What You Think: The 3I/ATLAS Case

## We Failed This Person

Recently, I received a comment on my analysis of 3I/ATLAS that revealed something deeply troubling — not about the commenter, but about our collective failure as scientists, educators, and communicators. Here's what they wrote:

> "With all due respect, focusing your energy on finding 'evidence against' a competitor's hypothesis is a scientifically lazy approach. It turns exploration into a courtroom drama.
>
> Science is not about debunking the unknown; it is about proving the known. If you are convinced 3I/Atlas is a natural object, the burden of proof is on you to provide affirmative data for your 'Dirty Snowball' theory. Demanding that Loeb disprove his own hypothesis while you offer no better explanation for the anomalies is not rigorous science — it's just academic gatekeeping.
>
> Ambiguity in the face of the unknown is a virtue. Certainty without data is a sin."

Just a small example of how citizen scientists work. Without grants or large teams, they do their work at the best level they can. [LINK]

This person is clearly intelligent, curious, and well-read. They care about truth and resist what they perceive as institutional arrogance. These are admirable qualities.

But they are also profoundly mistaken about what science is. And that's not their fault.

As [Carl Sagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan) wrote in [*The Demon-Haunted World*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Demon-Haunted_World): "We've arranged a society based on science and technology, in which nobody understands anything about science and technology… This combustible mixture of ignorance and power, sooner or later, is going to blow up in our faces."

The commenter has gotten, as Sagan would say, all the science filtered out before it reached them. This post is an attempt to remedy that. It is not about "winning" an argument, but to clarify what science actually is and how it actually works.

## 1. The "Freddy Krueger Effect": An Army of Instant Experts

There's a phenomenon I've observed in the 3I/ATLAS discussion that I call the "Freddy Krueger effect". A nightmare version of the [Dunning-Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect). The nightmare where suddenly everyone online becomes an expert on cometary dust dynamics, orbital mechanics, and interstellar object composition.

Here's what strikes me as particularly problematic: I have (co-)authored at least three peer-reviewed papers ([1], [2], [3]) on cosmic dust in the interstellar medium. I've worked with molecular clouds, studied dust formation and evolution, and spent years developing expertise in this narrow domain.

And yet, I fully recognize my limitations when it comes to cometary dust tail observations.

Why? Because a comet's environment is fundamentally different from the surfaces of molecular clouds where I've done most of my work. The physics of dust in the intense solar radiation field, interacting with outgassing volatiles, experiencing rapid heating and sublimation… requires a distinct expertise that I do not possess.

If I wanted to contribute meaningfully to understanding 3I/ATLAS's dust behavior, I would need at least a year of dedicated study to match the knowledge of colleagues who specialize in cometary science. This is epistemic humility, a cornerstone of scientific thinking, radical opposite of the dominating [Dunning-Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect).

Yet I see people reading three Medium articles and confidently declaring they understand cometary dynamics better than planetary scientists who have spent careers studying these objects. Well… rather than cometary physics they claim to know everything about alien technology, I would rather say.

Richard Feynman captured this perfectly: "Science is the belief in the ignorance of experts"… including the recognition of our own ignorance.

I do not want to add noise to an already noisy topic. I want to bring light to it. Therefore, I defer to those who know better, rather than pretending expertise I don't have.

## 2. Individual Heroes vs. The Meta-Mind

The commenter praises individual "citizen scientists" working alone "without grants or large teams."

This romantic vision of the solitary genius is deeply embedded in our culture. However, it's also deeply misleading about how modern science actually works.

Science today succeeds not through isolated individuals but through collaborative meta-minds. A proper scientific investigation of something as complex as 3I/ATLAS requires:

- Orbital dynamicists who understand gravitational interactions and trajectory evolution
- Spectroscopists who can interpret chemical composition from light spectra
- Dust physicists who model particle behavior under various conditions
- Statistical analysts who can evaluate probabilities and significance
- Solar wind experts who understand charged particle interactions
- Computational modelers who can simulate complex scenarios

No single person, no matter how brilliant, can master all these domains at the level required for definitive conclusions.

This is precisely the fundamental error of most Loeb followers: they approach 3I/ATLAS as solo investigators making sweeping claims across multiple complex domains, while ignoring or dismissing specialists in each field.

The contrast is instructive. When I analyze Loeb's statistical claims, I can do so with confidence. Statistics and data analysis are core competencies of my work in biomedical AI, and my last article uses bibliography I am very familiarised with, since it is part of my previous papers. When I evaluate orbital mechanics (here, here) arguments, I rely on well-established tools and peer-reviewed methods. When questions move into detailed cometary physics, I explicitly acknowledge my limitations and defer to experts.

This isn't weakness. It's how science actually works.

I have my work, my life, and my family. I cannot attempt to become a world expert in every aspect of cometary science to evaluate one object. But a collaborative community of experts, each contributing their specialized knowledge, can collectively arrive at robust conclusions.

Loeb presents himself as the lone visionary fighting the establishment. But he's really just an individual refusing to engage seriously with the collective expertise of planetary science.

## 3. Science is Not a Courtroom, but a Torture Chamber for Ideas

Let's address the first major misconception directly:

> "Focusing your energy on finding 'evidence against' a competitor's hypothesis is a scientifically lazy approach."

This statement reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of how science actually progresses.

Historically, science emerged precisely because humans are extremely good at convincing themselves they are right:

- Aristotle was convincing … but wrong.
- Ptolemy was predictive … but wrong.
- Newton was astonishingly accurate … and still wrong or incomplete.

[Karl Popper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Popper) didn't introduce [falsification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability) because scientists enjoy "debunking." He introduced it because confirmation is cheap and self-deception is easy.

In science, a hypothesis that cannot survive serious attempts to refute it has not earned the right to be taken seriously. Trying to find where an idea fails is not laziness. It is called epistemic hygiene.

[Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman), as brilliant as always, elaborated on this in his famous ["Cargo Cult Science"](https://calteches.library.caltech.edu/51/2/CargoCult.htm) speech:

> The first principle is that you must not fool yourself… and you are the easiest person to fool. So you have to be very careful about that. After you've not fooled yourself, it's easy not to fool other scientists.
>
> If you're doing an experiment, you should report everything that you think might make it invalid. Not only what you think is right about it.

A good scientist actively tries to falsify their own hypothesis. They lean over backwards to show where they might be wrong. Loeb should be doing this, but he isn't. And in the previous article I was simply showing what was wrong about it.

## 4. The Burden of Proof is the Opposite as Most People Think

Let me paraphrase the commenter:

> "If you are convinced 3I/Atlas is a natural object, the burden of proof is on you to provide affirmative data for your 'Dirty Snowball' theory."

This sounds fair, but it profoundly misunderstands scientific explanatory hierarchies.

Science does not treat all hypotheses symmetrically. Extraordinary hypotheses require new entities (alien civilizations), new mechanisms (interstellar propulsion), and new assumptions (extraterrestrial technology reaching our solar system).

That is the reason behind requiring disproportionately stronger evidence for such extraordinary claims, as stated and popularized by [Occam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_of_Ockham), [Hume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hume), and the great late Sagan.

A natural explanation for a cosmic object is not a "competing theory" with equal burden to an alien probe hypothesis. It is the default null model until evidence forces us to abandon it.

We have observed thousands of comets, hundreds of objects with unusual features, 3 and counting interstellar objects. We have observed exactly zero confirmed alien technological artifacts… Despite willingness to believe the opposite.

The prior probability matters. Claiming that a natural explanation and an alien technology explanation bear equal burdens of proof is like saying:

- "You found hoofprints in the mud — prove they're from a horse, not a unicorn"
- "There's a light in the sky — prove it's Venus, not a UFO"
- "Someone recovered from illness — prove it was medicine, not divine intervention"

This is not gatekeeping. This is how inference under uncertainty works.

Sagan explained this beautifully: "Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. Otherwise, we would have to accept every claim of miracle, ESP, and alien visitation that comes along."

## 5. Ambiguity is a Virtue… When Disciplined

The commenter writes:

> "Ambiguity in the face of the unknown is a virtue. Certainty without data is a sin."

The first sentence is correct… when paired with proportional belief updating.

But ambiguity does not mean:

- Treating all explanations as equally likely
- Protecting a hypothesis from erosion by evidence
- Remaining perpetually "suggestive" without converging predictions
- Using uncertainty as a shield against scrutiny

Sagan addressed this directly: "Keeping an open mind is a virtue — but, as the space engineer James Oberg once said, not so open that your brains fall out."

In science, ambiguity is a temporary state, not a permanent rhetorical position.

A scientific hypothesis must:

- Make testable predictions
- Risk failure
- Become less ambiguous as data accumulates
- Be abandoned or refined when evidence contradicts it

Otherwise, it is not exploratory. It is insulated from reality.

Loeb's approach with 3I/ATLAS exemplifies this problem. When evidence contradicts his "anomalies", he still keeps them as such. This is not maintaining productive ambiguity. This is rendering a hypothesis unfalsifiable. Therefore, by [Popper's criterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability), unscientific.

## 6. The Myth of Dogmatic Science

There's a persistent narrative that science is dogmatic, that it resists new ideas, that revolutionaries are persecuted.

Let's examine this claim historically.

Albert Einstein challenged Newtonian gravity. The most tested, most successful theory in the history of physics. Hundreds of years of precise observations confirmed Newton's equations to extraordinary accuracy. Hell, we even get to other planets and beyond using Newton laws.

When Einstein proposed that Newton was incomplete, did the scientific establishment reject him?

No. Within a decade, he was celebrated as one of the greatest physicists who ever lived. He received the Nobel Prize (for the photoelectric effect, no for general relativity…) He became the public face of genius itself.

Why? Because he provided extraordinary evidence for his extraordinary claim:

- Precise predictions (Mercury's perihelion precession)
- Novel testable phenomena (gravitational lensing)
- Mathematical rigor
- Explanatory power beyond Newton's framework

Alfred Wegener proposed continental drift in 1912. The scientific community was skeptical, even hostile, initially.

But Wegener, unlike Loeb, had good evidence:

- Matching coastlines across continents
- Identical fossil records on separated landmasses
- Geological formations that aligned when continents were reassembled
- Paleoclimatic data showing tropical fossils in polar regions

The problem wasn't his data — it was that he lacked a mechanism (plate tectonics wasn't understood until the 1960s). When seafloor spreading was discovered and the mechanism became clear, Wegener was posthumously vindicated. He is now regarded as one of the great scientific visionaries.

When someone with good evidence challenges the consensus, science eventually validates them and grants them the highest honors.

If science were truly dogmatic Einstein would have been rejected, Wegener would have remained discredited, quantum mechanics would never have been accepted.

Wegener had good data and lacked a mechanism. Loeb has a mechanism (alien technology) but lacks data supporting it.

As Feynman said: "For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for nature cannot be fooled."

## 7. Science is Not About "Proving the Known"

The commenter states:

> "Science is not about debunking the unknown; it is about proving the known."

This is perhaps the most revealing misconception.

Science does not "prove" in the mathematical sense. It constrains, models, and eliminates error.

As Popper explained: "We can never rationally justify a theory. We can only corroborate it by failed attempts to falsify it."

Progress happens not when we defend ideas, but when we let reality correct them.

- Newton's theory wasn't "proven". It was extraordinarily useful and predictive until Einstein showed where it failed.
- Einstein's theory isn't "proven". It works magnificently in most circumstances but breaks down at quantum scales.

No theory is ever final. No conclusion is ever certain. Science is a process of progressive refinement, not proof.

Indeed, the scientific laws we know are nothing else than those first attempts to describe reality, disfigured by the scars of data and observation. Newton's gravity bears the wounds inflicted by Mercury's perihelion; general relativity itself shows the marks of quantum mechanics at the Planck scale. The Big Bang theory carried the scars of horizon and flatness problems until inflation was proposed to heal them. Even inflation itself now bears new scars from observations that challenge its predictions.

Each scar is a victory, not a defeat. Each wound reveals where reality pushed back against our assumptions. The theories that survive are not the pristine, untested ones. They are the battle-tested frameworks that have been repeatedly wounded by reality and adapted to survive.

What distinguishes science from other ways of knowing is not that it proves things true. It's that it has a mechanism for discovering when we're wrong.

## 8. Science vs. Pseudoscience

Let me be explicit about what separates scientific thinking from pseudoscientific thinking, using 3I/ATLAS as the case study:

The commenter's statements align almost perfectly with the pseudoscience column:

- Claims burden of proof is on skeptics
- Portrays criticism as "gatekeeping"
- Defends ambiguity as permanent state
- Praises individual over collaborative approach
- Accuses skeptics of laziness rather than engaging with evidence

## We Can Do Better

To the person who wrote that comment: you are not wrong to resist dogmatism. You are not wrong to celebrate curiosity. You are not wrong to question authority.

But science is not what you think it is.

Science is not conservative, nor rebellious, nor speculative by default.

It is something rarer and more uncomfortable: a method that forces us to earn our confidence and to lose it when reality disagrees.

That discipline, not certainty or ambiguity alone, is what separates science from storytelling.

And Loeb's approach to 3I/ATLAS is not revolutionary science fighting dogma.

It is storytelling dressed in scientific language. And it deserves to be recognized as such.

Not because we fear new ideas, but because we demand that extraordinary claims be supported by extraordinary evidence.

That's not gatekeeping.

That's science.

Science is not a collection of facts — it's a way of thinking. When we lose sight of that, we lose the ability to distinguish truth from fiction.
