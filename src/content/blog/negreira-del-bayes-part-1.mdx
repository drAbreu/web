## Introduction: A Scandal That Shook Spanish Football

In March 2023, one of the most serious scandals in Spanish football history came to light: the [**Barça-Negreira Case**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negreira_case). The facts are, to say the least, surprising: FC Barcelona paid **more than 8 million euros** between 2001 and 2018 to José María Enríquez Negreira, who during that period served as **Vice President of the Technical Committee of Referees (CTA)** of the Royal Spanish Football Federation.

In their defense, Barcelona's directors, led by current president Joan Laporta (who at the time significantly increased payments to Negreira), claim these payments were for "neutral refereeing advice." It is now up to the judges to deliver their verdict.

Although judicial and scientific evidence don't always go hand in hand (eyewitness testimony in trials has great validity while its scientific evidence is null), a case like this presents us with a great opportunity. To use something as dark as the scandalous payments to one of those responsible for an institution that delivers sporting justice to introduce the public to a series of concepts about statistics and how to determine whether a statistic is truly significant or not.

This is the first of a series of three articles that will deal with the statistical analysis of certain anomalies that occurred during those years of payments to Negreira.

We'll start by looking at how to use mathematics to discover a rigged system, using dice as an example. In the second article, we'll apply what we learned in this first one to Spanish league statistics, and we'll finish by comparing what happened in Spain during those leaden years of payments and what, at the same time, happened in an independent competition like the Champions League.

### Why Does This Matter?

The question that naturally arises is: **Did these payments have any real effect on the field of play?**

It's a difficult question to answer definitively. We cannot read referees' minds. We don't have access to private conversations. But what we **can do** is analyze the statistical data of all yellow and red cards shown in La Liga during that period... And see what the cold data tells us about this matter.

And this is where the story gets interesting.

## An Educational Journey: Learning Statistics Through Football

This analysis is not just about the Barça-Negreira Case. It's also an **educational opportunity** to understand fundamental statistical concepts that help us distinguish between:

- **Coincidence** vs. **Significant pattern**
- **Random noise** vs. **Real signal**
- **Chance** vs. **Causation**

Throughout these three parts, we're going to learn about:

1. **Bayes' Theorem** - How to update our beliefs with new evidence
2. **P-values and statistical significance** - How unlikely is a result?
3. **Sigma deviations** - How far is something from "normal"?
4. **Natural experiments** - How comparison with other data validates our findings

We'll use football as a vehicle, but the concepts we'll learn are universal and applicable to any data analysis.

## The Dice Analogy: Fair or Loaded?

Before diving into the Barça-Negreira case data, let's start with a simple example that will help us understand statistical reasoning.

### Experiment: Two 6-Sided Dice

Imagine you're playing a dice game with a friend. You use **two 6-sided dice** and add up the results. After many games, you notice that your friend seems to get high sums more often than normal.

**Is it your bad luck or loaded dice?**

Statistics helps us answer this question.

### What Do We Expect from Fair Dice?

With two fair 6-sided dice, each face (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) should appear with the same probability: **1/6 or 16.67%**.

If we roll the dice thousands of times, we would expect to see each face approximately **16.67% of the time**. Let's see this visually:

![Expected distribution of fair dice](/blog/negreira/dice_probs.png)
*Figure 1: Expected distribution when rolling two fair dice 10,000 times. The red dashed line shows the expected frequency (1/6 = 1,667 times). The blue and orange dice show almost identical and balanced distributions.*

**Observe in the figure:**
- Each face (1-6) appears approximately **1,667 times** (16.67% of 10,000)
- The two dice (blue and orange) have almost identical distributions
- No face stands out significantly
- The variation is small and symmetric around the red line

**This is what we expect from a fair system.**

### What If One Die Is Loaded?

Now imagine that **one of the dice is loaded** to favor the number 6. Instead of the expected 16.67%, let's say it rolls a 6 **30% of the time** (almost double).

Let's see how everything changes:

![Composite statistical graph of four histograms comparing the probability distribution of the sum of two fair dice versus one fair and one loaded. The graphs show how the bias toward the number 6 shifts the frequency curve toward higher sums (7-12) and reduces the probability of getting low sums.](/blog/negreira/fair_vs_biased_dice_comparison.png)
*Figure 2: **Impact of a loaded die on the sum distribution.** The **upper left panel** shows the symmetric probability distribution expected when rolling two fair dice. In contrast, the **upper right panel** illustrates how introducing a loaded die (favoring 6) shifts the curve to the right. The **lower panels** detail this discrepancy: the direct comparison (left) and the difference graph (right) show that high sums (7-12) increase dramatically in frequency at the expense of low sums (2-6), which appear less than expected.*

**Evident changes:**
1. **Upper right panel (key):** The loaded die (orange) shows 6 almost **3,000 times** instead of ~1,667
2. **Upper left panel:** High sums (7-12) are more frequent with the loaded die
3. **Lower left panel:** Absolute differences - high sums have +200-400 extra appearances
4. **Lower right panel:** The sum 12 (6+6) increases almost **80%** in frequency

### Are These Differences Significant?

This is where **inferential statistics** comes in. It's not enough to see differences - we need to know if they are **statistically significant** or could be due to chance.

We use the [**Chi-square test**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_test), which answers: *"If the die were NOT loaded, what is the probability of observing these differences by pure chance?"*

**Test result:**
- **Chi-square:** 373.80
- **P-value:** 3.51 × 10⁻⁷⁴ (an incredibly small number!)

**What does p = 3.51 × 10⁻⁷⁴ mean?**

It means that the probability of seeing these differences by pure chance is practically **ZERO**.

To put this in perspective:
- **p < 0.05** → "Probably not chance" (evidence)
- **p < 0.01** → "Very probably not chance" (strong evidence)
- **p < 0.001** → "Almost certainly not chance" (very strong evidence)
- **p = 10⁻⁷⁴** → "**Absolutely impossible that it's chance**" (total certainty)

### What Do We Conclude from the Dice Example?

When we see an event with practically **zero** probability of occurring by chance, we have two options:

1. **Accept that we had extraordinary cosmic luck** - We witnessed a statistical miracle
2. **Conclude that the die is loaded** - There is something systematic causing the result

---

## Introduction to Bayes' Theorem

Now that we understand how to detect loaded dice with statistical tests, let's learn an even more powerful tool: **[Bayes' Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem)**.

Bayes allows us to **update our beliefs step by step** as we receive new evidence.

### Experiment: A Suspicious 4-Sided Die

Imagine I give you a 4-sided die (a tetrahedron with faces numbered 1, 2, 3, 4).

**Initial question:** Is it a fair die?

**Your initial belief (prior):** You're skeptical. You think there's only a **1% probability** that it's loaded.

- P(loaded) = 0.01 (1%)
- P(fair) = 0.99 (99%)

Now we start rolling the die...

### Roll 1: It lands on 4

**Evidence:** The die landed on 4.

**Conditional Probabilities:**

* **If the die is fair:** The probability of getting a 4 is P(4 | fair) = 0.25 (25%). This is because all faces are equally likely.
* **If the die is loaded for 4:** The probability of getting a 4 increases significantly to P(4 | loaded) = 0.90 (90%). The die will almost always land on 4.

**Interpretation:** The expression P(4 | fair) reads as "*the probability that the die rolls a 4, given that the die is fair*".

**We apply Bayes:**

```
P(loaded | rolls 4) = [P(4|loaded) × P(loaded)] / [P(4|loaded) × P(loaded) + P(4|fair) × P(fair)]

P(loaded | rolls 4) = [0.90 × 0.01] / [0.90 × 0.01 + 0.25 × 0.99]
P(loaded | rolls 4) = 0.009 / (0.009 + 0.2475)
P(loaded | rolls 4) = 0.009 / 0.2565
P(loaded | rolls 4) ≈ 0.035 = 3.5%
```

**Update:** Your belief went from **1%** to **3.5%**. You're still skeptical, but a little less so.

### Roll 2: It lands on 4 again

Now your **new prior** is 3.5% (the posterior from the previous roll).

**We apply Bayes again:**

```
P(loaded | 2 fours) = [0.90 × 0.035] / [0.90 × 0.035 + 0.25 × 0.965]
P(loaded | 2 fours) = 0.0315 / (0.0315 + 0.2413)
P(loaded | 2 fours) ≈ 0.115 = 11.5%
```

**Update:** From 3.5% to **11.5%**. You're starting to suspect...

### Roll 3: It lands on 4 again

```
P(loaded | 3 fours) = [0.90 × 0.115] / [0.90 × 0.115 + 0.25 × 0.885]
P(loaded | 3 fours) ≈ 0.319 = 31.9%
```

**Update:** From 11.5% to **31.9%**. You're no longer so sure it's fair!

### Roll 4: It lands on 4 AGAIN

```
P(loaded | 4 fours) ≈ 0.635 = 63.5%
```

**Update:** Now you think it's **more likely** that it's loaded (63.5%) than fair (36.5%).

### Rolls 5-10: All land on 4

We continue applying Bayes:

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

**After 10 consecutive rolls on "4", your certainty is 99.9%.**

### What Did We Just Do?

**This is the power of Bayes' Theorem:**

1. **We started skeptical:** Only 1% belief in bias
2. **Each piece of evidence updates:** Each "4" that comes up increases our certainty
3. **Evidence accumulates:** 10 consecutive fours → 99.9% certainty
4. **We don't need absolute certainty from the start:** Bayes allows us to be skeptical but honest with the data

**General Bayes formula:**

```
P(Hypothesis | Evidence) = [P(Evidence | Hypothesis) × P(Hypothesis)] / P(Total Evidence)
```

Or in words:

> Belief AFTER seeing data = (Probability of data if hypothesis true × Belief BEFORE) / Total probability of data

### The Key Lesson

Bayes tells us: **It doesn't matter how skeptical you are at first. If the evidence is strong enough, you MUST update your belief.**

- You started at 1% → You ended at 99.9%
- The data forced you to change your mind
- This is rational thinking, not confirmation bias

## Setting the Stage for the Barça-Negreira Case Analysis

Now that we understand:
1. How to detect improbable patterns (the dice)
2. How to update beliefs with evidence (Bayes)

We can apply exactly the same reasoning to the Barça-Negreira case.

### The Direct Analogy: From 6-Sided Die to 4-Sided Die (Quartiles)

We just saw how to detect a loaded 6-sided die. Now let's apply this reasoning to football, but with a small change of perspective.

#### What Are Quartiles?

In statistics, **quartiles** divide an ordered data set into **4 equal parts** of 25% each:

- **Q1 (Quartile 1):** The lowest 25% (fewer cards)
- **Q2 (Quartile 2):** The next 25%
- **Q3 (Quartile 3):** The next 25%
- **Q4 (Quartile 4):** The highest 25% (more cards)

**Analogy:** It's as if each season, each team **rolls a 4-sided die** and lands in one of these four quartiles.

**If everything is random** (no favoritism), each team should spend approximately:
- **25% of the time in Q1** (fewer cards)
- **25% of the time in Q2**
- **25% of the time in Q3**
- **25% of the time in Q4** (more cards)

#### The Analogy Applied to the Barça-Negreira Case

Now let's think about Barcelona during the Negreira period (2005-2018):

- **The 4-sided die** = The 4 possible positions of a team in yellow cards (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4)
- **Rolling the die 14 times** = 14 seasons (2005-2018)
- **Landing on "1" all 14 times** = Being in Q1 (fewer cards) all 14 seasons
- **Is the die loaded?** = Was there systematic referee favoritism?

## Important Note: Academic and Educational Nature

This is a **statistical analysis for exclusively educational purposes**. We want to be completely transparent about what this study can and cannot demonstrate:

### What This Analysis IS:

✅ **An educational exploration** of statistical methods applied to real data

✅ **A demonstration** of how Bayes' Theorem and significance tests work in practice

✅ **A correlation analysis** between time periods and data patterns

✅ **An opportunity** to learn to distinguish between signal and noise in large datasets

### What This Analysis IS NOT:

❌ **NOT legal proof** of direct causality

❌ **NOT identifying guilty parties** individually nor proving intentions

❌ **NOT a substitute** for judicial or forensic investigations

❌ **NOT establishing causal relationships** (correlation ≠ causation)

### Academic Context

This analysis follows the tradition of academic studies that use publicly documented events as case studies for teaching. Similar to how:

- Testimony from the Clinton-Lewinsky case has been used in psychology studies on how people lie
- The Volkswagen scandal is used in business ethics courses
- The Enron case is taught in accounting fraud analysis

In our case, the fact **documented by the Civil Guard** that payments of more than 8 million euros existed to the Vice President of the Referees Committee over 17 years allows us to formulate legitimate statistical questions:

- Are there unusual patterns in the data during that period?
- How improbable are these patterns if we assume randomness?
- How do they compare with different periods or competitions?

**The goal is to illuminate, not to accuse. To present data, not sentences. To teach statistics, not to deliver justice.**

The documented facts provide context. Mathematics provides the tools. The reader draws their own conclusions.
