# Has 3I/ATLAS Lost Its WoW Effect? (Part IV, and Probably Last)

**Last minute note:** In his last post, Loeb claims now that 3I ATLAS is observing the inner planets transit in front of the Sun to detect technosignatures. This is similar to what we already explained here, so I will not go into it. However, I would post a question. Imagine yourself in NYC, on a cloudy night, and look at the sky… How many stars, moons, planets you will see? Now imagine yourself in 3I ATLAS, surrounded by a coma so bright that we can observe 200+ Mkms away. What would you expect to see? You are part of a civilization able to reach interstellar travel… You really go to another star to observe planets through solar transits?

In this fourth, and most probably last, of our series examining the claims about interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, we turn to one of the most intriguing connections proposed: could this comet be the source of the famous "Wow! Signal" detected in 1977?

The claim is straightforward: 3I/ATLAS was traveling from "approximately" the same direction as the Wow! Signal when it was detected on August 15, 1977. The probability of such an alignment? About 0.6%, according to Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb. This sounds remarkably low, suggesting something extraordinary might be at play.

But is this coincidence really as remarkable as it seems? Let's do the math.

## The Wow! signal?

On August 15, 1977, Ohio State University's Big Ear radio telescope detected a strong, narrowband radio signal that lasted exactly 72 seconds. The full time the telescope could observe any given point as Earth rotated. Astronomer Jerry Ehman discovered the anomaly days later and famously wrote "Wow!" on the printout, giving the signal its name.

The signal appeared to come from the constellation Sagittarius, with coordinates:

- **Right Ascension:** 19h 25m 31s (±10s) [J2000]
- **Declination:** -26° 57' (±20') [J2000]
- **Galactic coordinates:** l ≈ 11–12°, b ≈ -19°

Despite decades of follow-up observations, the signal has never repeated. Its origin remains one of astronomy's enduring mysteries. Various explanations have been proposed, from natural astrophysical phenomena to terrestrial interference, to technological signatures, but no consensus has emerged.

## Where was 3I/ATLAS in 1977?

According to Loeb's trajectory reconstruction, on August 15, 1977, 3I/ATLAS was located at:

- **Right Ascension:** 19h 40m (295°)
- **Declination:** -19°
- **Distance:** Approximately 600 AU from the Sun

This places the comet about 600 times farther from the Sun than Earth is. In the distant outer solar system, slowly approaching on its interstellar trajectory.

## How far apart they really are?

Here's where things get interesting. When we calculate the actual angular separation between these two positions on the sky, we find:

**Angular separation:** 8.4 degrees (3.6 in Right Ascension and 8 in declination). Roughly the extension of your closed fist when set at arm's length in front of your face.

Now, 8.4 degrees might not sound like much to someone unfamiliar with astronomy. But let's put this in perspective:

- The full Moon appears about 0.5 degrees across in the sky.
- This means the separation between 3I/ATLAS and the Wow! Signal is approximately **17 times the angular diameter of the Moon**.

Imagine looking at the Moon in the night sky. Now imagine placing 17 full Moons end-to-end. That's how far apart these two positions actually are.

In astronomical terms, this is not a small separation. It's actually quite substantial.

Signal location with its uncertainty region. The 8.62-degree separation (517 arcminutes) spans approximately 17 Moon-widths — a substantial distance by astronomical standards. Concentric circles show the separation scale in units of Moon diameters.*

## Another Geller trick… the probabilistic illusionist

As we show in a previous post, this is another example of playing with probabilities to increase the anomalous feeling of something, otherwise perfectly normal. Loeb calculates that the probability of two random directions aligning this closely is about 0.6%. This calculation is technically correct, but what does it really mean?

The entire sky contains 41,253 square degrees. A circle with an 8.4-degree radius covers about 0.53% of the sky — roughly matching Loeb's calculation.

But here's the crucial context: **We've only detected three interstellar objects ever.**

If we ask "What's the probability that at least one of these three objects would randomly align within 8.4 degrees of a famous astronomical event like the Wow! Signal?", the calculation becomes:

- Probability that one object does NOT align: 99.4%
- Probability that all three do NOT align: (0.994)³ = 98.2%
- Probability that at least one DOES align: 1–0.982 = **1.8%**

So with three interstellar objects detected, there's about a 1 in 55 chance that at least one would randomly fall within 8.4 degrees of the Wow! Signal's position. This is not particularly remarkable from a statistical standpoint.

Moreover, this assumes we're only looking at one "famous astronomical event." If we consider all the notable astronomical phenomena, coordinates, and historical observations we could potentially match against, the probability of finding some coincidental alignment increases dramatically. This is a form of the "look-elsewhere effect". When you search through many possible matches, finding one becomes much more likely. Geller's sleight-of-hand all around.

## In the Galactic context: A populated region

Beyond the angular separation issue, there's an important consideration about the Wow! Signal's location. The signal's galactic coordinates (l ≈ 11–12°, b ≈ -19°) place it in the direction of the inner Milky Way, looking toward populated regions of our galaxy.

The signal's frequency was detected at approximately 1420.4556 MHz, close to the neutral hydrogen line at 1420.4058 MHz. This frequency shift suggested a radial velocity of approximately 10–11 km/s in the Local Standard of Rest (LSR) frame.

Signal's longitude), multiple Galactic structures show velocities in the range of 10–20 km/s, including the Sagittarius-Carina and Scutum-Centaurus spiral arms.

## A coincidence in context

If the signal's velocity interpretation is taken at face value, a source moving at ~10–11 km/s at galactic longitude 11–12° would be consistent with structures in the Sagittarius-Carina spiral arm at a distance of several thousand light-years. However, we must be cautious here: the galactic plane in this direction is a densely populated region containing numerous potential radio sources: molecular clouds, H II regions, stellar remnants, and other astrophysical phenomena. And these are most likely not to send a single channel narrow signal.

The true nature of the Wow! Signal remains uncertain, and its narrow, single-channel character makes definitive identification challenging. The point here is simply that the signal's characteristics place it in a region of the Galaxy where transient radio emissions are not unexpected, making a Galactic origin at least as plausible as (and certainly more straightforward than) an extragalactic or nearby interstellar source. And note that possible Earth-bound interferences must be take into the equation too!!

## What about the energy

Let us now consider what it would take for 3I/ATLAS to have transmitted the Wow! Signal and then changed course to its current trajectory.

### The Scenario

If 3I/ATLAS emitted the Wow! Signal, it would have been:

- Moving at roughly 10 km/s toward Earth (based on the signal's blueshift)
- Located 600 AU from the Sun
- In the direction of the Wow! Signal

But we observe 3I/ATLAS today:

- Moving at 60 km/s relative to the Sun
- Coming from a direction 8.4 degrees away from the Wow! Signal

For 3I to go from one trajectory to the other would require changing its velocity by approximately 50 km/s. Both in magnitude and direction.

Note that this has implicitly an assumption: WoW and 3I ATLAS were at the same distance. This is quite a long shot on its own.

### The energy required

For a comet nucleus estimated at 1 km in diameter (mass ~260 billion kg, assuming typical comet density of 500 kg/m³), the energy required for this trajectory change would be:

**3.3 × 10²⁰ Joules**

To put this in perspective:

- Equivalent to 78,000 megatons of TNT
- Equal to 1,560 Tsar Bombs (the largest nuclear weapon ever tested)
- Equivalent to 6.5 months of ALL human energy production on Earth

This is still an absolutely staggering amount of energy. For comparison, the entire annual energy consumption of human civilization is only about 600 exajoules (6 × 10²⁰ Joules).

Even if we assume this energy was applied gradually over the 48 years between the Wow! Signal (1977) and 3I/ATLAS's arrival in the inner solar system, it would require a sustained power output of approximately **216 billion watts**, continuously, without interruption, for nearly half a century. And then, I would ask… Why then is 3I ATLAS not showing that propulsion since we found it?

To put this into perspective, that's equivalent to:

- 216 large nuclear power plants running at full capacity for 48 years
- More than 10 times the total power generation capacity of the entire United States (which is about 1,200 GW total installed capacity)

For a 1-kilometer rock drifting through the cold vacuum of space, maintaining such an enormous power output for nearly five decades is beyond implausible… Although I'll admit that technologies can always be imagined that make that possible. But here is where observations of natural compounds around 3I ATLAS should come and give quite a reality check on the most plausible nature of our visitor.

## The Bigger Picture

This analysis doesn't mean 3I/ATLAS isn't interesting. It absolutely is! Interstellar comets are fascinating objects that can teach us about planetary systems beyond our own. Every one we detect provides valuable data about the composition and formation of distant solar systems.

But some extraordinary claims simply do not survive closest scrutiny. The claimed connection to the Wow! Signal, when examined carefully, rests on:

- A fairly large angular separation presented as "close"
- A probability calculation without proper statistical context
- A velocity signature that's at least consistent with Galactic sources in that direction… Not even knowing whether WoW and 3I where in the same place 50 years ago.
- An energy requirement that defies plausibility

And even when there are other chemical and composition anomalies, most of them already explained such as the Ni/Fe, there is no an immediate need to invoke technological origin. Anomalous natural objects in the vastness of space have been consistently discovered over the last decades. None of them so far has proven to be technological in nature. A single anomaly might be technological, but it is the entire picture what brings the debate into a close. And for a few technical possibilities, 3I ATLAS show many other absolutely natural phenomena. Technological origin, remember, MUST ALSO EXPLAIN THOSE. Otherwise, it is simply no a contender.

## The broader context: When anomalies aren't anomalous

The "Wow! Signal" connection represents the seventh claimed anomaly associated with 3I/ATLAS, classified by Loeb as a "Medium anomaly, which could be a statistical fluke" (P=0.006). However, when examined systematically across our article series, a clear pattern emerges: extraordinary claims that dissolve under closer scrutiny.

In our previous analyses, we examined the most significant anomalies — specifically, four of the six "Major anomalies with no simple explanation" from Loeb's own classification system. Each analysis revealed substantial flaws:

### Anomaly #1 — The Jupiter Hill Radius "Coincidence" (P=0.00004): Second article

The precise match with Jupiter's Hill radius is a natural consequence of the comet's existing trajectory and standard cometary outgassing, not evidence of a calculated orbital insertion maneuver. More critically, the energy requirements for any deliberate trajectory adjustment toward Jupiter are orders of magnitude beyond what's physically possible for a passive object. The maneuver would require propulsion capabilities far exceeding anything humanity has achieved. We will, however, be watching closely when 3I/ATLAS makes its close approach to Jupiter in March 2026 to see if nature has any surprises in store.

### Anomaly #2 — The "Fine-Tuned" Arrival (P=0.00005): First article

The claim that 3I/ATLAS timed its arrival to visit multiple planets while remaining hidden from Earth is a textbook example of the "Texas Sharpshooter" fallacy: drawing a bullseye around where the arrow has already landed. When calculated properly without cherry-picking specific planetary configurations, the actual probability of this trajectory is P ≈ 0.07 (7%), which is not remotely anomalous by any scientific standard.

### Anomaly #3 — The Mass/Population Paradox (P&lt;0.001): Third article

The claim that "there isn't enough rocky material in interstellar space" to produce objects like 3I/ATLAS collapses under scrutiny. The calculation suffers from multiple critical flaws: (1) Detection bias: it fails to account for the fact that larger, brighter objects are vastly easier to detect than smaller ones, skewing our sample toward the massive end; (2) Sample size: drawing conclusions about size distributions from just three objects is statistically meaningless; and (3) Denominator manipulation: the analysis claims only 5 years of survey time when we've been systematically surveying for comets and asteroids for over 25 years. When these errors are corrected, the apparent "anomaly" disappears entirely. There is no mass paradox.

### Anomaly #6 — The Ecliptic Alignment (P=0.002): First article

A retrograde trajectory aligned within 5 degrees of the ecliptic has a probability of approximately 0.2%, making it statistically uncommon. However, in a galaxy containing trillions of small bodies and countless interstellar objects, rare events happen constantly. This is an outlier in our tiny sample of three interstellar objects, but it's not a physical impossibility or evidence of design. As our detection capabilities improve and our sample size grows, we expect to find more such statistical outliers.

## So… Where do anomalies stand?

Of Loeb's six "Major anomalies," our series has now addressed five and found, not only natural or statistical explanations, but shown that some of them do not even classify as anomalies by any scientific standard. Such is the case of the fifth anomaly we've examined: the Wow! Signal connection, is classified by Loeb himself as only a "Medium anomaly, which could be a statistical fluke" (P=0.006). As we've shown, it requires physics-defying energy expenditures, involves a substantial angular separation, and the signal's origin must equal the position of 3I ATLAS... Something not proven at all.

## Conclusion: The Null Hypothesis still stands tall

Science advances by assuming natural explanations until evidence demands otherwise. The principle of the null hypothesis. In the case of 3I/ATLAS, we now have natural or statistically expected explanations for the most "impossible" claims.

When four of six "Major anomalies" have straightforward explanations, and even the "Medium anomalies" require physics-defying energy expenditures, the technological hypothesis loses its evidentiary foundation.

3I/ATLAS remains a magnificent messenger from another star system. Its 60+ km/s journey across the cosmic void, its pristine chemistry from a distant planetary system, and its silent passage through our solar neighborhood are genuinely extraordinary. We don't need to manufacture alien technology to appreciate this wonder. Its natural story is remarkable enough.

Could 3I ATLAS still be shown to be technological? Sure. There are still odds, minimum based on my interpretation of current evidence, but we will keep monitoring it. And when data does no longer fit ANY of the natural explanations, we will sure turn our eyes towards alternative explanations, including technological if they show to deserve extra attention. This is the way science works.

As we've explored throughout this series, the distinction between legitimate scientific inquiry and speculative extrapolation is crucial. Science is, on its very core, speculation. But speculation not backed up by evidence is not science anymore. 3I/ATLAS deserves our scientific attention precisely because it's real, measurable, and naturally spectacular. The best option we ever had of studying pristine material of unfamiliar stellar systems.

The universe is strange and wonderful on its own. Infinite mysteries still wait for us to be found and understood… 3I ATLAS surely keeps some of them.
