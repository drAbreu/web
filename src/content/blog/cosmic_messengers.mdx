# Cosmic Messengers: How Two Rocks Are Rewriting the Story of Life

> *"The nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth, the iron in our blood, the carbon in our apple pies were made in the interiors of collapsing stars. We are made of starstuff."* — Carl Sagan

Two rocks are rewriting our understanding of life's origins. One is Bennu, a pristine asteroid from our Solar System's birth. The other is 3I/ATLAS, an interstellar comet carrying the chemical signature of an alien star system. Together, their stories reveal something profound: the molecular building blocks of life are not unique to Earth. They're woven into the fabric of the universe itself.

## Bennu: A Time Capsule from the Solar System's Birth

Bennu is a carbon-rich asteroid barely half a kilometer across, virtually unchanged for 4.5 billion years. A pristine fossil from before Earth existed. In 2020, NASA's OSIRIS-REx spacecraft touched its surface for mere seconds, collected samples, and brought them home.

When those samples arrived in September 2023, scientists found something extraordinary. First came the five nucleobases (guanine, cytosine, adenine, thymine, and uracil) the molecular letters that spell out DNA and RNA. The words that make up our own stories. Similar compounds had been found in meteorites before, such as the [Murchison meteorite](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.0912157107) or the [Tagish Lake meteorite](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1203290), but those could have been contaminated after landing on Earth, therefore providing not such a esceptional evidence as Bennu is presenting us.

Then, a mere days ago, came the breakthrough. In a paper published in *Nature Geoscience* led by Yoshihiro Furukawa,["Bio-essential sugars in samples from asteroid Bennu"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-025-01838-6), scientists announced they'd found **ribose** (the sugar backbone of RNA) and **glucose** (the energy molecule of life on Earth). This was pristine material from space, uncontaminated, containing the molecular architecture of life.

The ribose in Bennu's dust is the same sugar in your RNA right now. The glucose is identical to what's in your bloodstream. **We are continuous with the cosmos.**

A companion paper in *Nature Astronomy* by Scott A. Sandford revealed something even more profound: evidence of **pre-aqueous cryochemistry**: complex organic molecules forming and linking together before water ever existed on Bennu's parent body. This is prebiotic chemistry happening in the frozen vacuum of space, not on Earth. If it happened here, it's happening in countless other stellar systems.

## 3I/ATLAS: A Message from Another Star

When 3I/ATLAS was detected, speculation ran wild. An alien spacecraft? The internet exploded with theories, fueled by a Harvard astronomer who suggested technological origins despite evidence to the contrary. But the truth makes such speculation look small. Indeed, such a speculation takes too much away from the magnificent truth behind life's origins.

**3I/ATLAS is far more remarkable as a natural object than it could ever be as an artificial one.**

In November 2024, ALMA (the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array) observed 3I/ATLAS in detail. The results, accepted for publication in [*The Astrophysical Journal Letters*](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2511.20845), revealed a chemically rich comet producing extraordinary amounts of two crucial molecules:

* **Methanol (CH₃OH)** — in far greater abundance than Solar System comets  
* **Hydrogen cyanide (HCN)** — streaming from its nucleus

To astrobiology researchers, these detections are electrifying.

The maps reveal the spatial distribution of these life-building molecules as 3I/ATLAS approached the Sun. The asymmetric distribution shows enhanced methanol production on the sunward side.

## Why These Molecules Matter

**Hydrogen cyanide**, despite its deadly reputation, is a fundamental precursor to life. Under the right conditions, it reacts to form amino acids (protein building blocks) and nucleobases (like those in Bennu). The famous [Miller-Urey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller%E2%80%93Urey_experiment) experiment showed how HCN serves as a key intermediate in creating life's complex molecules from simple starting materials.

**Methanol** acts as a chemical stepping stone. More reactive than simpler carbon compounds, it can transform into sugars, amino acid precursors, and other organic molecules essential for cellular life.

I spent countless nights at the IRAM 30-meter telescope (Granada, Spain) observing these same molecules in molecular clouds, star-forming regions, protoplanetary disks, and solar system comets. They pervade our stellar backyard wherever stars are born and planets form.

But 3I/ATLAS is different. **It's a messenger from another star system.** Its chemistry reveals that the molecular pathways that led to life on Earth aren't unique to our neighborhood. They're universal.

The blueward offset and asymmetry reveal complex outgassing dynamics. Credit: Cordiner et al., ApJ Letters (2025, in press)*

## Panspermia and the RNA World

The convergence of Bennu's samples and ALMA's observations of 3I/ATLAS powerfully supports **panspermia**. The idea that life's molecular precursors are distributed throughout the cosmos by comets and asteroids. I must admit, I used to be against this theory for proposing a scenario of... Well, yes life originated somewhere else... But we are just shifting the actual problem. However, this evidence can only tell me... I might have been wrong all along.

The implications cascade outward:

* Our young planet was bombarded by bodies like Bennu, each delivering organic molecules to Earth
* Other star systems experience the same cosmic seeding
* If comets like 3I/ATLAS travel between stars carrying methanol, HCN, and other organics, they're distributing life's raw materials across the galaxy

This doesn't guarantee life. You still need time, energy, liquid water, and sustained favorable conditions. But **the ingredients are everywhere.** It is like we have arrived from the supermarket, but there is still cooking to do to pass from the raw materials to life. That seems to be the role of planets.

These findings also reinvigorate the **RNA World hypothesis**: that early life was based on RNA alone, not DNA. RNA can both store genetic information *and* catalyze reactions (like proteins), making it uniquely suited as the original molecule of life. DNA might be a later evolutionary refinement. The clues to this is that we have found ribose, which is the sugar backbone of the RNA. The sugar backbone of the DNA, on the other hand, is deoxyribose, yet to be found in the cosmic wilderness.

If the building blocks in Bennu and the chemistry in 3I/ATLAS are universal, then **RNA-based biochemistry might be the universal path to life.** Wherever these cosmic messengers deliver their cargo and conditions align, RNA might emerge as the first genetic material. We're witnessing the outline of a universal biochemistry.

## Science Needs No Embellishment

Three papers in two weeks represent one of the most significant advances in astrobiology and origins of life research in decades, maybe ever. Yet when Dr. Loeb published [his response](https://medium.com/@avi-loeb/is-3i-atlas-a-friendly-gardener-or-a-serial-killer-b51a449c0dd1) to the ALMA observations, he barely acknowledged that 3I/ATLAS might be natural, never explicitly retracting his claims of artificial origins. He didn't celebrate what deserves celebration: we're observing a piece of another stellar system carrying the chemical signature of universal life-building processes.

This is harmful. When we obscure natural wonders with wild speculation, we teach people that reality needs aliens to be interesting. We erode trust in science. **The truth is more than enough.** We live in a universe where life's chemistry emerges naturally from physics, where every star system is a potential nursery, where matter itself carries the seeds of consciousness.

## The Universe Knowing Itself

Here's what we've learned: Ribose, glucose, and nucleobases exist in pristine samples predating Earth. Methanol and HCN stream from a comet born around another star. The chemistry that led to life on Earth occurs throughout the galaxy, likely throughout the universe.

We're not isolated. The atoms in our bodies were forged in stars, but more, the very molecules that enable life were assembled in space, in disks around infant stars, in ancient ices. After 14 billion years of chemical evolution, hydrogen atoms created in the dawn of time have evolve in a life form that, even with all its mistakes, can achieve astronomical wonders and decipher the very beginning of time. All using our most powerful nature exploration tool: Science.

**We are the universe examining itself.**

Life isn't Earth's privilege—it's the universe's privilege. And we bear a responsibility: to protect that privilege, to recognize we're part of something vast and ancient.

If you are looking for something to feel special (even you should already feel it), you can always keep in mind that these findings point to a RNA-based life in the cosmos. However, DNA-based life remains an Earth bound system. Maybe RNA is an evolution trick that is unique to us. Maybe not. Time will tell.

3I/ATLAS will leave our Solar System, continuing its galactic journey. But it's given us a gift: knowledge that life's chemistry is woven into the cosmic fabric. Bennu's samples continue revealing secrets locked away since before Earth existed. 3I/ATLAS is that interstellar ship that has been claimed, but not an artificial one. A natural one. A ship that the universal gravity brings to us, pre-interstellar travelling civilization, so that we can actually observe how other systems are born. How other life forms, likely made out of RNA, are born.

These comets aren't just rocks. They're messengers with a clear message: we belong to something far greater than ourselves. We are the cosmos awakening, conscious, filled with wonder at its own existence.

Nature and cosmos are far greater than any fantasy, but fantasies drive our imagination and research. Keep both. Be a dreamer kid, be a critical thinking adult.

Keep looking up. Keep searching. Keep marveling.
