# 3I/ATLAS: An Interstellar Permafrost Comet — A Natural & Testable Hypothesis for Anomalous Behaviour

**NOTE:** I am quite baffled to see that exactly this morning a new paper came out: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.08591](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.08591) basically agreeing with the predictions shown in this post. A scientific preprint with the hypothesis can be found here: [https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.34496.80642](https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.34496.80642)

## A data-driven natural hypothesis

3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1) keeps generating intense debate. While some have suggested extraordinary explanations for its unusual behavior, I propose a natural hypothesis grounded in established astrophysics: 3I/ATLAS is a radiation-hardened permafrost object whose anomalies can be explained by its ancient origin and billion-year journey through interstellar space.

I used for this hypothesis actual observations and background knowledge in researching gas/dust interfaces in low-metallicity galaxies like M33 and interstellar dust properties, that is quite relevant given the possible origin of the object. Metal-poor stellar environments produce dust grain populations fundamentally different from our Solar System. This is the core of the hypothesis.

## 1. Ancient origins: Billions of years of cosmic ray processing

Multiple lines of evidence suggest 3I/ATLAS formed during the Milky Way's era of peak star formation, 7–13 billion years ago (Bolin et al. 2025). Its kinematics suggest either a thick-disk or thin-disk origin, scientists are still debating (Guo et al. 2025, Pérez-Couto et al. 2025), but all agree: this object is ancient.

### The 20-Meter "Radiation Shield"

The extreme CO₂/H₂O ratio (8:1) observed by JWST and SPHEREx (Maggiolo et al. 2025) is among the highest ever recorded. This isn't primordial chemistry. That is the result of Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR) processing over billions of years. Laboratory experiments demonstrate that GCR irradiation converts CO ice into CO₂ while synthesizing organic-rich crusts (Hudson & Moore 2001). Erosion calculations indicate current outgassing samples only this processed layer, approximately 15–20 meters deep.

This represents a paradigm shift: long-residence interstellar objects reveal GCR-processed "permafrost" rather than primordial composition. While the interior may remain pristine (we don't know this), the outer shell has been transformed into a rigid, insulating mantle (Trigo-Rodríguez et al. 2025).

Thermal models indicate a low albedo (&lt;0.2) surface requiring significant time to absorb solar heat before outgassing begins, consistent with an insulating crust. The thermal lag between solar heating and peak outgassing activity suggests substantial thermal inertia, though quantitative modeling is ongoing.

## 2. Dust properties in 3I ATLAS. Large grains?

### Dust properties from the extreme negative polarization

The "unprecedentedly deep negative polarization" observed for 3I/ATLAS (-2.7%, Gray et al. 2025) provides crucial constraints on the coma's dust properties. While low-metallicity environments are traditionally thought to be dust-poor, several mechanisms in the early galaxy favor 3I's unique population:

**Supernova Ejecta:** In metal-poor environments, massive stars are more common. Large grains can form in supernova shocks and be ejected into interstellar space (Marini et al. 2021). Indeed, that 3I ATLAS was originated by a cataclismic event such a SN explosion would be a very plausible explanation of why it could have run away from its stellar system in the first place.

**Interstellar Coagulation:** During a billion-year journey through dense molecular clouds, dust grains can "clump" together, increasing grain size significantly (Hirashita 2012).

**GCR-Synthesized Organics:** This created a hard, insulating surface mantle — essentially, an interstellar permafrost (Maggiolo et al. 2025).

These three well documented processes would convert the dust of 3I ATLAS into a mixture of large fluffy aggregates, ice, and dark organic materials.

The polarization signature resembles that of some Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs), suggesting surface material enriched in processed organics and ice mixtures. Laboratory experiments show that frost layers on dark surfaces, all consistent with the documents presented above, can produce deep negative polarization minima similar to 3I/ATLAS.

Combined with GCR-synthesized organics, this created a hard, insulating surface mantle. Essentially, 3I ATLAS is an interstellar permafrost.

## 3. The "Carbonyl" Solution to Chemical Anomalies

No core to my hypothesis, but still other natural explanation for 3I ATLAS observations. One of the most debated features was the extreme Ni/Fe ratio early in the observation period. Rather than suggesting an artificial alloy, this is explained by differential sublimation of organometallic compounds (by Hutsemékers et al. 2025):

**Nickel Tetracarbonyl [Ni(CO)₄]:** Highly volatile; it sublimated beyond 3 AU, releasing atomic nickel early.

**Iron Pentacarbonyl [Fe(CO)₅]:** Less volatile; it remained frozen until the comet crossed the 2.64 AU threshold.

Once 3I/ATLAS crossed this thermal line, Iron began to sublime, and the Ni/Fe ratio normalized to levels consistent with 2I/Borisov and standard Solar System comets. This "false positive" of a nickel-rich object is a natural consequence of sequential heating.

## 4. The Anti-Tail and Delayed Activation

### The "Blue" Perihelion Shift: Gas vs. Heat

Early observations showed 3I/ATLAS remained quiescent until 3 AU, followed by rapid brightening event with a hyper-steep brightening index (~r⁻⁷·⁵, Zhang & Battams 2025). This marks a dramatic threshold event: solar heating finally penetrated the 20-meter insulating crust, triggering a pressurized release of CO₂.

This dramatic threshold event was told in every interview by Avi Loeb to mean "3I/ATLAS was hotter than the Sun". I must 100% disagree with his interpretation of this effect.

Certainly, at perihelion, 3I/ATLAS shifted from a reddish dust-scattered hue to a distinct blue. While Loeb suggested this required surface temperatures exceeding 5,800 K (the blackbody temperature of the Sun), the physics of cometary comas tells a different story. This blueing is the signature of resonance fluorescence. Specifically, the sudden dominance of C₂ Swan bands and CN emission, pumped by solar UV radiation, overwhelmed the red-reflecting dust continuum. This wasn't a sign of 'heat' in the thermal sense, but a sign of a threshold breach where CO₂-driven outgassing flooded the coma with carbon-chain molecules.

The sudden appearance of these species suggests the threshold breach released multiple volatile reservoirs: the dominant CO₂ drove the explosive outgassing, while water ice sublimation released CN and C₂ precursors that had been trapped in the ice matrix or synthesized by GCR processing in the organic crust.

This behavior is consistent with solar heating finally penetrating a thick insulating crust and triggering sudden, multi-component volatile release from a pressurized interior, revealing not just CO₂, but the complex chemistry of a radiation-processed surface encountering solar heat for the first time in billions of years.

### Why the tail appears sunward

My permafrost comet model offers a plausible, testable explanation for this anomaly. The persistent sunward anti-tail is likely composed of large, momentum-dominated grains.

**Pressure Release:** CO₂ gas found release through narrow cracks in the rigid permafrost, acting as natural nozzles that create highly colimated jets. Note that this would directly explain the new jets observed in the recent Hubble images of January 7th 2026 (here, raw images), as being jet another crack in the permafrost layer. This, however, proofs itself difficult to test without close flybys.

**Momentum Over Pressure:** These grains consist of silicate cores with organic/ice mantles. Because they are large (micron-to-millimeter scale), they are relatively insensitive to solar radiation pressure. They travel on their original orbital trajectory, appearing sunward to observers. Crucially, after ice sublimates away, the refractory cores persist indefinitely. They're solid silicate and organic particles that don't sublimate at all. The anti-tail remains visible over 100,000+ km not because ice persists, but because these permanent dust particles continue to scatter sunlight long after their volatile components are gone. This is similar to how meteor streams preserve comet orbits for millennia.

### Fixed rotation vs. New fractures

While 3I/ATLAS has shown a consistent 16.16-hour 'heartbeat' since its discovery in July 2025 (de la Fuente et al. 2025), we must distinguish between the early rotational light-curve and the active jetting observed recently. The triple jets seen by Hubble on January 7, 2026, appear to be new features. Structural breaches where internal CO₂ pressure finally fractured the 20-meter permafrost. The 'wobble' of these jets isn't a sign of artificial propulsion, but the simple result of gas being sprayed from a nucleus that has been tumbling since it left its home system billions of years ago.

## 5. Testable predictions

As 3I/ATLAS recedes from the Sun (currently at magnitude 15.6), we can test this permafrost model against upcoming data:

### 1. Understanding the "Smoking Gun" (JWST/MIRI)

**Physics:** Silicate dust exhibits a strong vibrational resonance near 10 microns due to Si–O stretching modes.

**Sharp peak in normal comets:** In typical comets dominated by sub-micron silicate grains, this feature appears as a sharp, high-contrast emission peak.

**3I ATLAS should flatten:** If the Permafrost Hypothesis is correct and the dust is dominated by large, fluffy aggregates, radiative transfer models predict a strong suppression and broadening of the 10-micron silicate feature, potentially producing a plateau-like spectrum rather than a sharp peak.

Dust polarimetry would also give an independent measurement of the dust grains. Both observations together would be a very powerful tool to assess this hypothesis.

**Importance:** JWST/MIRI observations in the 8–13 µm range provide one of the most direct remote-sensing diagnostics of dust grain size and structure. A significantly flattened or weakened silicate feature would strongly support the presence of large aggregates and validate a key assumption of the permafrost comet model. Conversely, a sharp, high-contrast feature would challenge this assumption and require substantial revision of the model.

### 2. Sequential Freeze-out

One of the strangest discoveries about 3I/ATLAS is its extreme nickel-to-iron ratio. Far from the Sun, astronomers detected nickel in the coma, but almost no iron. Only later, as the object warmed, did iron begin to appear.

This is not a mystery metal imbalance. The leading explanation is chemistry controlled by temperature.

Nickel and iron are thought to be released not from rocks or dust, but from highly volatile organometallic compounds: nickel tetracarbonyl and iron pentacarbonyl. These molecules behave very differently when heated. Nickel compounds vaporize first, while iron requires higher temperatures to escape.

The result is a natural sequence:

- **Cold phase** → nickel dominates
- **Warming phase** → iron catches up

In other words, the Ni/Fe ratio acts like a clock for how heat moves through the comet.

If 3I/ATLAS were a loose, thin shell, both metals would appear almost together as sunlight reached the interior. Instead, we see a staggered release, exactly what you would expect if heat must slowly diffuse through a thick, insulating permafrost layer before activating deeper chemical reservoirs.

This doesn't prove the permafrost model on its own. But it strongly supports the idea that 3I/ATLAS is thermally layered, not a fragile snowball that responds instantly to sunlight.

On the way out, 3I/ATLAS doesn't just switch off. Its thick insulating crust acts like a thermal battery, slowly releasing remaining volatiles. The freeze-out happens in layers, mirroring the staggered release we saw on the way in, but stretched across greater distances, like a sunset fading slowly rather than flipping off a light switch.

### 3. Thermal lag

**Physics:** If the 20-meter crust really is a good insulator, it will hold heat like an oven. It allows subsurface heat to persist long after peak solar heating. In such a scenario, volatile release can continue at large heliocentric distances due to delayed thermal diffusion.

**Prediction:** If cometary activity declines rapidly near ~3 AU, this would favor a relatively thin or weakly insulating surface layer. Conversely, sustained outgassing beyond 4–5 AU would strongly support the presence of a thick (~20 m) permafrost crust with high thermal inertia.

My permafrost model invokes only established physics (i.e., radiation chemistry, thermal diffusion, volatile sublimation, and gas dynamics) and it does offer 3 observations predictions that will definitely take place within the next three months. If they hold, I will probably be happy and a bit more sure of my proposal being on the right track. If they do not… I will be a bit hurt, put my permafrost into the "previous mistakes" shelf, but I will gladly see what other hypothesis better align with the future observations. This is how science proceeds.

I would love to actually build a proper model paper on this… But unfortunately life does not offer enough time, so I will simply sit on the observing bench and see what comes out.

## Conclusion: An ancient messenger requires careful study

3I/ATLAS challenges our understanding not because it requires exotic explanations, but because it may represent a class of object we've never closely observed: billion-year-old comets profoundly altered by interstellar radiation.

As 3I/ATLAS continues its outbound journey, observations through mid-2026 will test this model's predictions. If the hypothesis holds, we should see gradual activity decline, thermal lag effects, and eventual "freezing" of the vents as the comet returns to the cold of deep space.

Whatever we ultimately learn, 3I/ATLAS reminds us that the universe contains natural phenomena strange enough to challenge our intuition and that careful, quantitative science is needed to distinguish the genuinely anomalous from the simply unfamiliar.
