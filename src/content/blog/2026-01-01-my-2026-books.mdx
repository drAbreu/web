## 1. The Demon-Haunted World, Carl Sagan (1995)

![The Demon-Haunted World book cover](/images/demon-haunted-world.jpg)

This book is essential reading for every critical thinker. Some topics might feel outdated—the entire alien conspiracy chapter, for instance, not because these theories have disappeared, but because they've evolved differently in our time. However, other topics like New Age pseudoscience remain strikingly relevant today.

Sagan gives us what I consider the book's most valuable gift: "The Baloney Detection Kit." With these tools, we can identify pseudosciences masquerading as legitimate science and debunk unfounded claims. Throughout the book, Sagan shows genuine fear about what has now come to pass: a predominantly technological society growing up without the tools for scientific or critical thinking. That's a recipe for disaster—especially now that most power is concentrated in the hands of a few who control AI systems. There's never been a better moment to refuse to stop thinking for ourselves.

**A book that should be taught in schools.**

## 2. The Sandman: Preludes & Nocturnes (Graphic Novel), Neil Gaiman

A very dark, 80s-style comic about the Sandman. I'd read excellent reviews, but it wasn't my thing.

## 3. The Well of Ascension (Mistborn Vol. 2), Brandon Sanderson

**Masterpiece.**

Sanderson's world-building is exceptional. The way he explores how a group of revolutionaries faces the challenges *after* abolishing a totalitarian regime is brilliant. His treatment of the characters' internal thoughts and evolution—their fears and motivations—is simply perfect.

He crafts an entirely new universe with very specific magic systems, powers, and creatures, all bound to a single pivotal event. And he does so masterfully, making you *feel* the universe without resorting to extended, tedious descriptions. Instead, the world comes alive as the characters discover and experience it. While some of the romance elements might feel slightly repetitive at points, they play a crucial role in the overall outcome.

The creatures feel fresh and original. The entire plot feels innovative while still being a classic medieval fantasy. For me, it's the perfect blend of J.R.R. Tolkien's world-building (without his multi-page descriptions) and J.K. Rowling's direct action, atmospheric storytelling, and slow-building climax.

I can only recommend this book and its predecessor, *The Final Empire*.
