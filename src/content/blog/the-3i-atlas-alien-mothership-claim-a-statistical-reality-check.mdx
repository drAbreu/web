This is the first in a series systematically analyzing the claimed "anomalies" of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. Each post will examine one statistical or physical claim with the rigor it should have received before making international headlines.

The scientific community has not been silent about 3I/ATLAS. Over 50 peer-reviewed papers by well over 100 astronomers have documented its composition, activity, and dynamics using JWST, Hubble, VLT, Gemini, and dozens of other facilities. Every observation is consistent with a natural comet. It is true. It is exotic due to its interstellar origin, CO₂-rich composition, high nickel-to-iron ratio, high negative polarisation… but natural nonetheless.

Yet Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb's Medium posts have generated headlines proposing a series of anomalies that on his mind suggest the comet might be alien technology (See note below for clarification on this). These claims rely heavily on probability calculations that, as we'll see, are textbook examples of statistical manipulation. Let's start with the most egregious: the supposed "fine-tuning" of 3I/ATLAS's arrival time.

## Part 1: The Planetary Alignment That Wasn't

On July, 2025, the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) discovered what would become the third confirmed interstellar object passing through our Solar System: 3I/ATLAS (also known as C/2025 N1 ATLAS). Within weeks, Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb published a very legitimate and loable policy work in the sahpe of a thought experiment paper. However, this soon turn into sensationalism and what once was a loable thought experiment rapidly turned into uncovered claims of this comet might be alien technology: a "mothership" designed to seed our solar system with probes.

Among his claimed "anomalies," one stands out for its statistical sleight-of-hand (D&D moment there):

> "P=0.00005: The arrival time of 3I/ATLAS was fine-tuned to bring it within tens of millions of kilometers from Mars, Venus and Jupiter and be unobservable from Earth at perihelion."

Let's examine what actually happened, and why this claim reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of probability. Or worse, a deliberate misrepresentation of science.

## What Actually Happened

3I/ATLAS followed a hyperbolic trajectory through the inner Solar System, passing:

- Mars: 28.4 million km (0.19 AU) on October 3, 2025
- Venus: 97 million km (0.65 AU) on November 3, 2025
- Jupiter: 54 million km (0.36 AU) on March 16, 2026
- Earth: 267 million km (1.8 AU) on December 19, 2025

3I/ATLAS reached perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) at 1.36 AU on October 29, 2025 — between the orbits of Earth and Mars. At that time, Earth was on the opposite side of the Sun, making the comet unobservable from ground-based telescopes.

## The Post-Hoc Probability Fallacy

Loeb calculates a probability of 0.005% (1 in 20,000) for this "fine-tuned" arrangement. But this calculation commits a classic statistical error: computing the probability of a specific outcome after you've already observed it. This is an example of [post-hoc fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_hoc_analysis).

Consider this analogy: After shuffling a deck of cards, you deal yourself a specific hand. Say, the 7 of hearts, Queen of diamonds, 3 of clubs, Jack of spades, and 2 of hearts. The probability of getting exactly that hand is roughly 1 in 2.6 million. Does this mean the deck was rigged? Of course not. Some hand had to be dealt, and whichever hand appeared would have that same incredibly low probability.

The same principle applies to 3I/ATLAS. Any interstellar object on a hyperbolic trajectory will pass at some specific distances from some planets at some specific times. After the fact, we can always calculate an impressively small probability for that exact configuration. But without a prior prediction of what distances would be "suspicious," this probability is meaningless.

## The Monte Carlo Reality Check

To properly assess whether 3I/ATLAS's trajectory is truly anomalous, we need to ask a different question: If 3I/ATLAS arrived at 10,000 random times, how often would it pass "within tens of millions of kilometers" of at least 3 planets?

This is the difference between pre-hoc and post-hoc probability:

- **Post-hoc:** "What's the probability of this exact configuration?" (Answer: 0.005, as Loeb calculated)
- **Pre-hoc:** "What's the probability of passing close to any 3+ planets?" (Answer: Let's find out)

I ran a [Monte Carlo simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) with 10,000 trials, varying only the arrival time while keeping 3I/ATLAS's orbital parameters fixed. Let us see what the results say.

| Multi-Planet Encounter Class | Probability | Occurrences (out of 10,000) |
|------------------------------|-------------|----------------------------|
| At least 3 planets (< 100M km) | 6.2% | 620 |
| At least 4 planets (< 100M km) | 0.6% | 60 |
| At least 5 planets (< 100M km) | 0.13% | 13 |

In 620 out of 10,000 simulations (6.2%), 3I/ATLAS passed within 100 million km of three or more planets.

**Methodological note:** To test Loeb's claim about fine-tuned arrival time, we held 3I/ATLAS's orbital parameters constant (eccentricity, inclination, argument of perihelion, longitude of ascending node) and varied only the time of perihelion passage. This directly tests whether the temporal aspect of the trajectory is anomalous. The exact claim of Loeb.

One might argue that the orbit itself is special. However, that's a fundamentally different claim than "fine-tuned arrival time." Moreover, without knowing the true distribution of interstellar object orbits (3 is not enough to have any meaninful statistics), we cannot assess whether any particular orbit is improbable. We're testing the claim Loeb actually made: that the timing was suspiciously precise.

![Distribution showing how many planets were encountered in each simulation at the < 100 million km threshold](/blog/3iatlas_reality_check/figure_2.webp)
*Figure 2: Distribution showing how many planets were encountered in each simulation at the < 100 million km threshold*

This completely reframes Loeb's claim. Yes, the specific configuration observed (Venus at 97M km, Mars at 28M km, Jupiter at 54M km) is rare. Our simulations give it a probability of about 0.03% when you calculate the joint probability of those exact distances. But the broader category of "passing close to any three planets" occurs in more than 1 in 16 trajectories for this orbit.

![Number of simulations that came within various distance thresholds of each planet](/blog/3iatlas_reality_check/figure_3.webp)
*Figure 3: Number of simulations that came within various distance thresholds of each planet*

To put this in perspective: if we observed 16 interstellar objects with similar orbits, we'd expect at least one to have a three-planet close encounter. That's not a statistical impossibility requiring exotic explanations. It's a predictable outcome of orbital mechanics.

## What This Means

Loeb's calculation isn't wrong mathematically: the specific configuration is improbable at 0.03% (we could reproduce it in our simulations). But it's a textbook example of the post-hoc fallacy. He's calculating the probability of hitting the bullseye after the arrow has already landed, then claiming the shot was impossibly accurate.

The proper comparison is: "How unusual is it for some kind of multi-planet close encounter to occur?" And the answer is: not very unusual at all. It happens about 6% of the time for this orbital configuration. A percentage that would not pass scientific scrutiny.

This is like being dealt a royal flush in poker (extremely rare) versus being dealt any flush (much more common). Loeb is calculating the probability of the royal flush but comparing it to the significance threshold for getting any flush.

## Multiple Comparisons: The Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy

The situation is even worse than the card analogy suggests. Loeb is not just calculating the probability of one specific outcome. He's selecting which outcomes to highlight from a vast space of possibilities:

- Why these three planets (Mars, Venus, Jupiter) and not Mercury or Saturn?
- Why not emphasize the close approach to Earth, the only planet in this solar system with intelligent life that we know of? If this were truly a designed mission, wouldn't Earth be the primary target? If your answer is that they could try to approach us silently… There will be a post on this series showing that was never an option.
- Why "tens of millions of kilometers"? Would 100 million km be anomalous? 200 million? Who decided this threshold before observing the trajectory? The effect of tens of millions of kilometers will be very different at three planets as different as Mars, Venus, and Jupiter.
- Why count the perihelion solar eclipse as a separate "anomaly"? It's geometrically linked to the planetary positions — if you're near perihelion when Earth is on the opposite side, you're automatically hidden from Earth-based observers.
- What about all the ways 3I/ATLAS didn't align with anything special?

When you examine hundreds of potential patterns and cherry-pick the few that look interesting, you're guaranteed to find some "remarkable" coincidences. This is called the multiple comparisons problem.

### Understanding Multiple Comparisons

Imagine testing 100 hypotheses, each with a 5% chance of appearing significant by random chance alone. On average, you'll find 5 "statistically significant" results even if none of your hypotheses are true. This is why rigorous statistics requires adjusting your significance threshold when testing many hypotheses simultaneously (using methods like the [Bonferroni correction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonferroni_correction)).

Loeb is effectively testing hundreds of hypotheses:

- Did it pass close to Mars? Venus? Jupiter? Saturn? Mercury? Neptune?
- What about asteroid belts? Lagrange points? The heliopause?
- Did perihelion occur during solar minimum? Maximum? Eclipse season?
- Was it observable from Earth? Hidden from Earth? Both at different times?
- Did it arrive during any significant astronomical event?

With enough tests, some will appear "anomalous" purely by chance. This is the [Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_illusion). Firing bullets at a barn wall, then painting targets around the holes and claiming you're an expert marksman.

## The Failed Prediction: Evidence of Scientific Misconduct

More damning than the statistical errors is what Loeb initially claimed this "fine-tuning" implied. In a pre-publication paper with Eldadi and Tenenbaum, he stated:

> "An optimal intercept of Earth would entail an arrival in late November/early December of 2025"

In multiple Medium posts and media appearances, Loeb speculated that 3I/ATLAS might release "mini-probes near perihelion that might take advantage of the Sun's gravitational assist as they maneuver towards planets like the Earth," and suggested these probes could arrive "6 days before Christmas" as "gifts to humanity."

This prediction has been completely falsified.

> "the reported level of non-gravitational acceleration corresponds to a modest spatial deviation of order ten times the radius of the Earth over a period of a month, insufficient to bring 3I/ATLAS significantly closer to any Solar System planet from its original gravitational path"

The comet passed Earth at 1.8 AU, about 267 million kilometers, with no course correction toward our planet, no deployed probes, and no deviation from purely cometary behavior. The supposed "Oberth maneuver" to intercept Earth never happened. The "fine-tuned" alignment failed to produce any of the predicted outcomes. And do not expect it to work on Jupiter. As we will see in [a future post](/blog/3i-atlas-and-jupiter-what-it-really-takes-to-intercept-an-interstellar-object), there is no way 3I ATLAS can generate a Jupiter rendezvous maneuver given its current orbital parameters, regardless of it passing in or out of the Hill radius.

## The Outrageous Part: Still Counting it as an Anomaly

Here's where Loeb's behavior crosses from poor science into what can only be described as scientific misconduct:

Despite his own admission that the trajectory showed "insufficient" deviation to approach Earth, despite the complete failure of his Earth-intercept prediction, despite observing purely gravitational motion post-perihelion (albeit some non-gravitational acceleration due to outgassing), Loeb still lists this as his #2 most significant anomaly (P=0.00005) in his most recent compilations.

The entire justification for including "unobservable from Earth at perihelion" was that this eclipse would allow 3I/ATLAS to conduct a "clandestine reverse Solar Oberth Manoeuvre" to intercept Earth. That hypothesis is now falsified by observation. Yet rather than remove or downgrade this "anomaly," Loeb continues to prominently feature it in his alien technology case.

This is not how science works. When a prediction fails, you don't continue citing the reasoning behind that prediction as evidence. That's not scientific conservatism or maintaining an open mind. That's motivated reasoning at best, and deliberate deception at worst.

And he does all this while positioning himself as the saviour of science, the lone voice of reason against dogmatic colleagues who refuse to consider the evidence. The irony would be amusing if it weren't so damaging to public trust in science.

## The Broader Problem: Science by Press Release

These Medium posts are not being submitted to peer review. They're published directly to the public, complete with probability calculations that would never survive scrutiny from experts in statistics, orbital dynamics, or cometary science.

Over 50 peer-reviewed papers by hundredths of scientists (most of them absolutely independent of NASA, btw) have been published on 3I/ATLAS, documenting its composition, activity, spectroscopy, and dynamics. None conclude it shows evidence of artificial origin. Yet Loeb's Medium posts create the false impression that the scientific community is ignoring obvious anomalies, when in reality, they're simply rejecting bad statistics and unfounded speculation.

Meanwhile, these posts generate international headlines, appear on Fox News and NewsNation, and reach millions of people who lack the statistical training to spot the errors. The Medium platform becomes a megaphone for claims that would be rejected by any competent journal.

## What We Should Expect

This doesn't mean we should dismiss the possibility of technological interstellar objects. Rigorous scientific papers exploring detection methods and signatures of extraterrestrial technology (as the one Loeb himself coauthored) are valuable contributions to the field.

I want to be clear: the original goal behind the Eldadi, Tenenbaum, and Loeb policy paper was a great exercise. Using 3I/ATLAS as a case study to argue for increased planetary defense budgets and preparedness protocols for potential technological objects is a worthwhile exercise. We should have observation campaigns ready. We should have response protocols. We should think seriously about how to distinguish natural from artificial interstellar visitors. I subscribe to that approach 100%, and that work deserves to be studied and developed further without controversy.

But that's not what happened. What started as a legitimate policy paper ("here's what we'd need to do IF this were technology") has been corrupted into a media campaign actively promoting the claim that 3I/ATLAS IS alien technology. The discourse has shifted from preparedness planning to sensational headlines. Failed predictions are not acknowledged. Statistical fallacies are published uncorrected. The original, valuable goal has been abandoned, corrupted, twisted, in favor of maintaining a narrative that generates attention.

Whether this corruption stems from the sake of fame, media attention, book sales, or something else, we cannot know. But the transformation is undeniable, and that's what must be challenged. Bringing light to these statistical manipulations and scientific errors isn't about suppressing inquiry into extraterrestrial intelligenc. It's about defending the integrity of that inquiry. The public deserves honest science, especially on topics as important as planetary defense and the search for technological civilizations.

We should demand that claims (extraordinary or not) must be supported by evidence, not post-hoc probability calculations, failed predictions that continue to be cited as evidence, and cherry-picked coincidences.

When every observation can be explained by well-understood cometary physics, invoking alien technology isn't scientific or healthy skepticism. It's a betrayal of the scientific method and a disservice to the important work of genuine SETI research.

In the coming posts in this series, we'll examine the other claimed "anomalies" of 3I/ATLAS: the Wow! Signal alignment, the anti-tail jets, the non-gravitational acceleration, the nickel composition, and the Jupiter Hill radius "coincidence." In each case, we'll see the same pattern: selective data presentation, statistical errors, contradictions with peer-reviewed research, and a consistent failure to acknowledge that the scientific community has compelling natural explanations for every observed feature.

The universe is filled with genuine mysteries worthy of our attention and resources. 3I/ATLAS is one of them on its own right. Let us not take this away from her and give it to aliens.
