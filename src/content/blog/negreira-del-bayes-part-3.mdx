## The Definitive Proof: Champions League and the Red Card Balance

In [Part 1](/blog/negreira-del-bayes-part-1), we learned to detect loaded dice with Bayes' Theorem.

In [Part 2](/blog/negreira-del-bayes-part-2), we saw that Barcelona was in Q1 for 13/13 seasons (probability: 1 in 268 million) and that their rivals received more cards than any other team's rivals.

**The question that remained:** Is this about Barcelona (their quality, playing style) or is there something more related to payments to the vice president of the referees committee?

In this final part, we will reveal **the definitive proof**.

---

## Finding #4: The Red Card Balance

### What is the "Balance"?

The **red card balance** is a simple but powerful metric:

```
Balance = Red Cards to Rivals - Own Red Cards
```

**Interpretation:**
- **Positive balance (+):** Your rivals receive MORE reds than you → Advantage
- **Negative balance (-):** You receive MORE reds than your rivals → Disadvantage
- **Zero balance (0):** Perfect equilibrium

**Sports analogy:** It's like "goal difference" but with sending-offs.

### Calculating the Total Balance (2005-2018)

We sum **all red cards** across 13 complete seasons:

![Distribution of red card balance for the 40 La Liga teams](/blog/negreira/red_card_balance_distribution.png)
*Figure 1: **Distribution of red card balance for all teams that played in La Liga between 2005-2018.** Barcelona appears as a unique and extreme case with +47, while Real Madrid is perfectly balanced at 0. Most teams have balances close to zero, between +10 and -10.*

**Striking observations:**

1. **Barcelona: +47** - An extreme *outlier* with no close competition
2. **Real Madrid: 0** - Perfectly balanced, ranking #20 of 40 teams
3. **Difference Barcelona vs Real Madrid: +47 vs 0** - A gap of 47 cards
4. **2nd and 3rd place (Villarreal, Sevilla): +10** - Barcelona has **4.7x** the balance of second place
5. **League average: -2.4** - Most teams are close to zero or negative
6. **Barcelona is #1 of 40 teams** - Completely separated from the rest of the distribution

**Visual result:** Barcelona is completely isolated as an **extreme outlier** without comparison in recent La Liga history.

---

## Finding #5: Statistical Probability of the Balance

### How Improbable is +47?

If red cards were distributed randomly (null hypothesis), we would expect each team to have a **balance close to zero**.

Let's calculate the probability that Barcelona would get a balance of +47 by pure chance.

### Method 1: Binomial Test

Let's think of each red card in Barcelona's matches as a "coin flip":
- Heads = Red for the rival
- Tails = Red for Barcelona

**Total reds in Barcelona's matches:** 48 (Barcelona) + 95 (rivals) = **143 red cards**

**If it were 50/50 (fair):**
- We would expect ~71.5 for each side
- Barcelona received only **48** (much less)
- Rivals received **95** (much more)

**Binomial test:**
```
P(≤ 48 reds of 143 | p=0.5) = 0.0000525
```

**This is approximately 1 in 19,000**

**P-value:** 0.0000525 (highly significant, p < 0.001)

### Method 2: Z-Score (Sigma Deviation)

We calculate how far Barcelona is from the league mean:

- **Mean of balances:** -2.4
- **Standard deviation:** 11.0
- **Barcelona's balance:** +47

```
Z-score = (47 - (-2.4)) / 11.0 = 4.5σ
```

**Barcelona is 4.5 standard deviations above the mean.**

**Probability of Z ≥ 4.5:**
```
P(Z ≥ 4.5) ≈ 3.71 × 10⁻⁶
```

**This is approximately 1 in 269,000**

**Sigma interpretation:**
- **±1σ:** 68% of data (normal)
- **±2σ:** 95% of data (unusual)
- **±3σ:** 99.7% of data (very rare)
- **±4σ:** 99.994% of data (**extremely rare**)
- **Barcelona: 4.48σ** - Outside almost any natural distribution

![Statistical probability of Barcelona's red card balance](/blog/negreira/red_balance_statistical_probability.png)

*Figure 2: **Visualization of Barcelona's Z-score in the context of the normal distribution.** Barcelona is 4.48 standard deviations from the mean (-2.4), representing a probability of approximately 1 in 269,000. The shaded areas show the standard confidence intervals (±1σ, ±2σ, ±3σ), and Barcelona is completely outside even the ±4σ interval.*

### What Do These Numbers Mean?

Both methods tell us the same thing:

**The probability that Barcelona has a balance of +47 by pure chance is between 1 in 19,000 and 1 in 269,000.** We again encounter a concept seen in [Part 2](/blog/negreira-del-bayes-part-2) of this blog: it's more likely that a reader of this post will be struck by lightning next year or win the lottery than for such curious things to happen regarding cards in the Spanish league between 2005 and 2018.

In the context of **40 teams** in the league, this is statistically impossible to explain by chance.

## Bayesian Update #3: The Red Balance

Now we have **FOUR independent pieces of evidence**. Let's update Bayes once more.

### Accumulated Evidence

1. **Barcelona 14/14 in Q1** → P = 3.73 × 10⁻⁹ (1 in 268 million)
2. **Rivals ratio 1.51x in yellows** → P = 0.0027 (1 in 370, not significant by itself.)
3. **Red balance +47** → P = 5.25 × 10⁻⁵ (1 in 19,057)
4. **Busquets/Piqué Case: Documented double referee error** → P = 2.43 × 10⁻¹⁷ (1 in 41 quadrillion)

### Conservative Bayesian Calculation

Using the most conservative method (assuming some correlation between evidences):

**Prior:** 0.01% (extremely skeptical, as we established in [Part 1](/blog/negreira-del-bayes-part-1))

**Likelihood ratio (combined evidence):**
```
LR = P(evidences | bias) / P(evidences | no bias)
LR ≈ 0.50 / (3.73×10⁻⁹ × 0.0027 × 5.25×10⁻⁵ × 2.43×10⁻¹⁷)
LR ≈ 0.50 / (1.3×10⁻³²)
LR ≈ 4×10³¹ (40 quintillion)
```

> The number above, if it were in metric units, would be the equivalent of 10 light years. Imagine that in that astronomical distance you're told you must choose one meter of space to win a contest. Your chances of winning would be the same as the cumulative probability from the statistical evidence that the Spanish league data under the Negreira payments was coincidence.

**Posterior:**
```
Odds(bias | evidences) = LR × Odds(prior)
Odds = 4×10³¹ × (0.0001 / 0.9999)
Odds ≈ 4×10²⁷ to 1

P(bias | evidences) ≈ 99.999999999999999999999999% (27 nines)
```

### Interpretation

We started with **0.01% belief** (1 in 10,000).

After seeing the four accumulated evidences, our certainty is **>99.999999999999999999999999%** (27 nines).

**There is no reasonable statistical doubt.**

## The Causality Problem

Up to here, we have demonstrated:
- **There is a statistically significant pattern**
- **The pattern is extremely improbable by chance**
- **The pattern is unique to F.C. Barcelona**

**But...**

Statistics tells us that **correlation does NOT imply causation**.

All the alternative hypotheses we discussed in [Part 2](/blog/negreira-del-bayes-part-2) have a problem: they don't explain the data well. But technically, **we cannot completely rule out** that there is some factor about Barcelona as a team (quality, style, something we haven't measured) that causes this pattern.

### The Critical Question

**How can we know if the pattern is caused by:**
- **A) Barcelona's characteristics** (quality, playing style, discipline)
- **B) Intrinsic consequences of a Spanish competition in which the referee vice president received documented payments from F.C. Barcelona between 2001 and 2018.**

**The answer:** We need a **natural experiment** - a situation where Barcelona plays with the same elite rivals but with **different referees**.

**Fortunately, that experiment exists.**

---

## The Definitive Proof: Champions League

### The Perfect Natural Experiment

The **UEFA Champions League** provides us with the ideal scenario:

**Controlled variables (SAME):**
- ✅ Same team (Barcelona)
- ✅ Same players
- ✅ Same playing style
- ✅ Similar elite rivals
- ✅ Same competition level

**Experimental variable (DIFFERENT):**
- 🔄 **Referee committee:** UEFA assigns **international** referees, Negreira has no power in the Champions.

**Predictions of the two hypotheses:**
- **A) It's Barcelona** (quality/style) --> The favorable card pattern should **PERSIST**
- **B) The pattern is, in some unidentified way, related to payments to the CTA president** --> The pattern should **DISAPPEAR**

### Champions League Data (21st Century)

Let's analyze the **red card balance** for Barcelona and Real Madrid in **both competitions**:

![Comparison of red card balance: La Liga vs Champions League](/blog/negreira/champions_league_comparison.png)

*Figure 3: **Direct comparison of red card balance between La Liga (Spanish referees) and Champions League (UEFA international referees) for Barcelona and Real Madrid during the complete 21st century.** In La Liga, Barcelona has a +66 advantage over Real Madrid. In the Champions League, with the same teams but different referees, this advantage completely disappears (-1). Same teams, different referees, completely different results.*

**Source:** [Planeta Real Madrid Analysis (complete 21st century data)](https://www.planetarealmadrid.com/curiosidades/comparativa-entre-saldo-arbitral-barca-real-madrid-en-laliga_317934_102.html)

### What Does This Mean?

**In La Liga:**
- Barcelona: **+65** (rivals receive 65 MORE reds than Barcelona)
- Real Madrid: **-1** (practically balanced)
- **Difference:** Barcelona has **+66 advantage** over Real Madrid

**In Champions League:**
- Barcelona: **+12**
- Real Madrid: **+13**
- **Difference:** Barcelona has **-1** (Real Madrid has slightly MORE!)

### The Devastating Conclusion

**Barcelona's +66 advantage over Real Madrid (+37 over second place in the 2005-2018 interval) in La Liga COMPLETELY DISAPPEARS in the Champions League.**

**Same teams. Different referees. Different result.**

**This proves that the pattern is NOT about Barcelona (their quality, style, players).** It's some kind of external factor that could, **presumably**, be related to payments to the vice president of the Technical Committee of Referees of the Royal Spanish Football Federation.

**It doesn't matter how skeptical you are at the start. The data forces you to the same conclusion.**

### The Final Dice Analogy

Let's return to our 4-sided die from Part 1.

Imagine that:
1. **We roll the die 14 times** → It lands on "1" all 14 times (Barcelona in Q1 14/14)
2. **We measure the die's weight** → It's unbalanced toward "1" (rivals ratio 1.51x)
3. **We analyze 40 similar dice** → This is the ONLY one with so much bias (balance +47, #1 of 40)
4. **We test the die on a different table** → On the other table it lands normally (Champions League)
5. **We observe twice that the die "bounces" impossibly** → Two documented errors with probability of 1 in 41 quadrillion (Busquets/Piqué Case)

**Conclusion?**

> **With a probability of 99.999999999999999999999999%, the die is loaded.**

---

## Final Conclusions

Once again, we repeat that this has been an academic exercise to learn about probability and statistics using a real-world case. The numbers shown here are based on real data and purely statistical inferences from them. But here our analysis ends. Any inference of guilt or causality will be the sole and exclusive responsibility of the reader. We cannot prove anything more than the numbers.

**With statistical certainty >99.999999999999999999999999% (27 nines):**
1. ✅ Barcelona exhibited a **statistically (almost) impossible pattern** of favorable referee decisions during the Negreira period (2001-2018), (2005-2018 analyzed in these articles)
2. ✅ This pattern is **unique** - not observed in Real Madrid, Atlético, or any other team
3. ✅ The pattern is **specific to competitions under the mandate of the RFEF and CTA, of which Negreira served as vice president during the analyzed dates** - disappears in Champions League, a competition independent of the CTA vice-presided by Negreira
4. ✅ **Busquets/Piqué Case:** Two documented referee errors (unsanctioned second yellow) with probability of 1 in 41 quadrillion by chance
5. ✅ Five independent lines of evidence **converge** on the same conclusion

### What We Have NOT Proven

**With scientific honesty, we acknowledge:**
1. ❌ **We have NOT proven direct causality** - Statistical correlation, however strong, is not legal proof that payments to Negreira caused specific decisions
2. ❌ **We have NOT proven intention** - We cannot read individual referees' minds
3. ❌ **We have NOT proven conspiracy** - We have no evidence of explicit agreements
4. ❌ **We have NOT identified mechanisms** - We don't know exactly HOW the bias was produced (if it was produced)

### So, What Do We Have?

We have **overwhelming statistical evidence** that:

> During the period when Barcelona was paying millions of euros to the vice president of the Technical Committee of Referees, the club exhibited very favorable statistics, which are practically impossible to occur by simple chance.

**In the language of Bayesian statistics:**

**The dice landed on "1" fourteen times in a row. The dice are, with a probability of 99.999999999999999999999999% (27 nines), loaded.**

## 🤯 How Improbable Is This? Comparison with Other Events

To put in perspective the probability of the double referee coincidence in favor of Barcelona (P ≈ 1 in 41 quadrillion), let's compare it with other events considered statistically impossible by chance:

### 🔑 Key Observation: Perspective

The **Double Referee Coincidence in Favor of Barça** event is:

- **4.1 billion times more improbable** than winning the Christmas Lottery twice in a row.
- **41,000 times more improbable** than being struck by lightning twice in your lifetime.
- It's on the same probability scale as **finding a specific grain of sand** on all Earth's beaches and **choosing a specific air molecule** on the planet, **simultaneously**.

### 📢 Statistical Conclusion (Rejection of Chance)

From a rigorous statistical perspective, an event with such a low probability (≪ 5%) forces us to **reject the null hypothesis of chance**. The statistical evidence suggests that the pattern of coincidences cannot be explained by chance or mere incompetence, but points to a systemic factor or bias.

## The Broader Meaning

### Beyond Football

This analysis is not just about Barcelona or the Negreira Case. It's about:
1. **The power of data** - Numbers can reveal patterns that are invisible to the naked eye
2. **Bayesian reasoning** - How to update beliefs rationally when faced with new evidence
3. **The importance of transparency** - That's why all our code and data are public
4. **Natural experiments** - How comparison with Champions League gives us external validation
5. **Critical thinking** - Distinguishing between correlation and causation, between statistical evidence and legal proof

### Questions That Deserve Answers

This analysis cannot answer (nor does it intend to answer) questions such as:

- Who knew what and when?
- Were there explicit instructions to referees?
- What exactly did the "referee reports" contain?
- Was there intentional benefit or unconscious influence?

**But it DOES establish that these questions DESERVE to be answered.**

When the probability of a pattern by chance is **1 in 100 billion**, society deserves an exhaustive and transparent investigation.

## Final Note on Ethics and Objectivity

Statistical correlation is not legal proof of causality. But when the probability of chance is 1 in 100 billion, **it deserves serious investigation**.

**The goal is not to accuse. It is to illuminate.**

**Let the data speak. Let truth prevail.**
