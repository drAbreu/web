# 3I/ATLAS Has Been Turned Into the Bent Spoon of 21st Century Astronomy

Before anything:

The policy paper of Loeb is a great exercise and a very much needed effort.
Yes, we know. He does not claim 3I ATLAS is an alien probe. He just suggests it… But he is intentionally ambiguous and reluctant to accept evidence against that hypothesis.
I, as I am pretty sure a vast majority (if not totality) of my fellow scientists, assume that life emergence in other places of the Universe is a most probable, almost certain, possibility.
Is really regretful that what should have been a science celebration for an unprecedented, probably once-in-a-lifetime opportunity of 3I/ATLAS has been eclipsed for ill-founded speculations.

## How to Make a Normal Comet Look Alien With Statistical Sleight of Hand

In the 1970s, [Uri Geller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uri_Geller) captivated audiences by seemingly bending spoons with his mind. His trick? Focus attention on the dramatic moment of bending while using standard sleight-of-hand techniques and, most importantly, never acknowledging the mundane explanations. When skeptics like [James Randi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Randi) exposed the techniques, Geller simply moved on to the next trick, leaving believers convinced they'd witnessed something extraordinary.

One would think that such a D&D rogue showcases would stop existing… But reality always surprises. As we close out 2025, Geller compatriot Avi Loeb has published yet another piece about interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, this time wielding statistics like a cudgel. His conclusion? Either there are 10²³ similar objects in the Milky Way alone (requiring stars to process 10 Earth masses of material), or 3I/ATLAS must be targeting us through "technological design."

It's a classic false binary option. Here you have the data, cooked and prepared as I want. Now, accept an apparently absurd number, or accept alien technology. Modern day paraphrasing of: "If we do not understand something, then it must be God".

## Detection Bias: Astronomy 101

Anyone who lived through the exoplanet revolution of the 1990s-2000s knows this story:

Early exoplanet surveys found mostly "hot Jupiters". Massive gas giants orbiting close to their stars.

Did this mean hot Jupiters were the most common type of planet?

Absolutely not. It meant our detection methods (transit photometry and radial velocity) were biased toward finding large planets in short-period orbits. Small planets, distant planets, planets in face-on orbits — they were all invisible to our surveys, not because they didn't exist, but because we couldn't detect them (1).

Once we corrected for these selection effects, once we improved our technical analysis, once we increased our exoplanet sampling, we discovered that small, rocky planets are actually far more common than hot Jupiters (2). The "observed" distribution was wildly different from the "intrinsic" distribution.

## This Is Not New — It's Fundamental Astronomy

Detection bias toward larger, brighter objects has been a core challenge in astronomy for decades:

**[Initial Mass Function (IMF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_mass_function) and Initial Cluster Function (ICF):** When astronomers first tried to measure the distribution of stellar masses, they consistently underestimated the number of low-mass stars. Why? Bright, massive stars are easy to see across the galaxy. Faint, low-mass red dwarfs are incredibly difficult to detect beyond a few hundred light-years (3). Early IMF estimates were dramatically wrong because they didn't account for incompleteness — the systematic loss of faint objects from surveys.

It took decades of careful work to correct for detection biases and reveal that low-mass stars are actually the most common type of star in the galaxy. About 75% of all stars are red dwarfs (4). If we'd used Loeb's logic, we might have concluded that the "missing" low-mass stars were actually rare, or perhaps even artificial lamps lighting the streets of some interstellar city.

This is normal in astronomy: Things that are bigger and brighter are easier to see. The critical question is never just "how many did we detect?" but "how many did we miss?"

## Ants in our own backyard

We don't need to speculate about detection completeness. We can look at our own backyard:

**Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs):**

- Estimated population >140 meters: ~25,000 objects (6)
- Actually discovered as of 2025: ~34,000 (but this includes many <140m)
- Estimated population >1 km: ~1,000 objects
- Discovered >1 km: ~980 (98% completeness) (7)

We've been looking for decades with dedicated surveys, and we're still not complete even for the largest, most dangerous objects

**Main Belt Asteroids:**

- Estimated total population: several million objects >1 km
- Actually cataloged: ~1.3 million objects (but many are smaller than 1 km)
- Completeness for >10 km objects: ~99%
- Completeness for 1–10 km objects: ~40–60%
- Completeness for <1 km objects: <10% (8)

**Kuiper Belt Objects:**

- Estimated population >100 km: ~70,000 objects
- Actually discovered >100 km: ~200 objects
- That's 0.3% completeness for the largest, brightest category (9)

We've been studying our own Solar System for over 400 years with increasingly powerful telescopes, and we're still missing 99.7% of the large Kuiper Belt objects. And Loeb expects us to have a complete, unbiased census of interstellar visitors after detecting three of them?

The claim that it only took "5 years of observing" to find an ISO is a classic denominator bias. Using that 5-year figure is a "Geller trick" that ignores the broader historical context: asteroid-searching surveys have been active for more than a quarter-century. While Pan-STARRS 1 provided the first detection, dedicated all-sky surveys like LINEAR, Spacewatch, and the Catalina Sky Survey, Teide Observatory Tenerife Asteroid Survey, have been scanning the skies for over 25+ years (since the late 1990s). Ignoring these decades of "null results" (25) can only be described, again, as scientific misconduct.

## The Same Problem With Interstellar Objects

The ATLAS survey has:

- A limiting magnitude around 19–19.5 (10)
- Strong bias toward active objects (those with visible comae)
- Geometrical bias (only detects objects crossing the survey's field of view)
- Timing bias (object must be bright enough at detection distance)

As the Hubble Space Telescope team explicitly noted: 3I/ATLAS would have escaped detection by ATLAS if its cross-section and brightness had not been boosted by the dust coma (11). In other words, we only found it because it was unusually active.

A smaller, less active interstellar comet would have sailed right past us undetected.

## Power Laws and the Size Distribution

In natural populations of small bodies, the size distribution follows a power law:

N(>D) ∝ D^(-q)

where N(>D) is the number of objects larger than diameter D, and q is the cumulative slope parameter.

For the Kuiper Belt, observations show (12,13):

- Large objects (>100 km): q ≈ 4–5 (very steep)
- Small objects (<10 km): q ≈ 2–3 (shallower)
- Sub-kilometer regime: q ≈ 1.8–2.0

What does q=3 mean in practice? For every object at 1 km diameter:

- 8 objects at 500m diameter (2³)
- 64 objects at 250m diameter (4³)
- 1,000 objects at 100m diameter (10³)

We're not detecting those thousand 100-meter objects. Not because they don't exist, but because they're too small and dim for current surveys.

When Loeb uses 3I/ATLAS (the largest ISO we've detected) to extrapolate the population, he's making the same mistake early exoplanet and IMF researchers did — assuming the detected sample is representative when it's actually the biased tip of a much larger iceberg.

## Turning the Tables: The Civilization Density Problem

Now let's apply Loeb's own logic consistently. He claims both 1I/'Oumuamua (2017) and 3I/ATLAS (2025) show anomalies suggesting alien technology. Let's accept this premise and see where it leads.

Key facts:

- 2 detections in ~8 years (2017–2025)
- These objects came from different directions
- They have different velocities
- They have different trajectories

If both are alien probes, they almost certainly come from different civilizations. It would be an incredible coincidence if both probes from the same civilization happened to arrive within 8 years when launched from different directions at different times.

So we've detected 2 alien civilizations' probes in 8 years. Let's do the same calculation Loeb does:

### Detection Volume Calculation

The Solar System's gravitational cross-section for interstellar objects:

- Effective radius ~100,000 AU (Oort Cloud gravitational influence)
- Cross-sectional area: π × (10⁵ AU)² ≈ 3 × 10¹⁰ AU²

For an object moving at ~70 km/s (average of maximal 3I ATLAS and Oumuamua):

- Distance traveled in 8 years: 70 km/s × 8 years ≈ 1,800 AU
- Detection volume: 3 × 10¹⁰ AU² × 1,800 AU ≈ 5 × 10¹³ AU³

We detected 2 technologically advanced civilizations' probes in this volume.

### Extrapolating to the Galaxy

The Milky Way:

- ~100,000 light-years diameter, ~1,000 light-years thick
- Volume ≈ π × (50,000 ly)² × 1,000 ly ≈ 8 × 10¹² ly³
- Converting: 1 ly ≈ 63,000 AU
- Galactic volume ≈ 2 × 10²³ AU³

Number density of probe-launching civilizations:

- From our detection: 2/(5 × 10¹³ AU³) ≈ 4 × 10⁻¹⁴ per AU³
- Scaled to galaxy: 4 × 10⁻¹⁴ × 2 × 10²³ ≈ 8 million civilizations advanced enough to have reached interstellar travel capacities.

If Loeb is correct that both ISOs are alien probes, there must be roughly 8 million probe-launching civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy right now.

## The Absurdity Check

Let's compare this to the [Drake Equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation), the standard framework for estimating technological civilizations:

N = R★ × fp × ne × fl × fi × fc × L

Even with optimistic estimates (14):

- R★ (star formation): 7/year
- fp (stars with planets): 1.0
- ne (habitable planets per system): 0.4
- fl (planets developing life): 1.0
- fi (life developing intelligence): 0.01
- fc (intelligence developing technology): 0.1
- L (lifetime of technological civilization): 10,000 years

This gives N ≈ 2,800 civilizations in the galaxy.

Loeb's interpretation requires civilizations to be 3,000 times more common than even optimistic Drake estimates. And these aren't just any civilizations. They're ones capable of launching interstellar probes that survive journeys of millions or billions of years.

## Where Are All The Others?

If there are 8 million probe-launching civilizations:

- Where are all the other probes?
- Where are the radio signals?
- The megastructures?
- The atmospheric pollution signatures on exoplanets?
- Why are we still alive?

The [Fermi Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox) asks "where is everybody?" Loeb's interpretation doesn't solve it. It makes it 8 million times worse.

This is the real absurdity hidden in Loeb's statistical argument. He wants you to think a trillion natural comets per star is ridiculous, but his alternative requires millions of technological civilizations all launching probes that conveniently look exactly like comets, produce no radio signals, and leave no other evidence of their existence than HCN, CO, C₂, C₃, Fe, Ni, CN, COOH₃… All of them elements seen in natural molecular clouds, protoplanetary systems, asteroids and comets.

## The Real Population Estimate: Doing the Math Honestly

Let's redo Loeb's calculation with proper detection bias corrections.

### Correction #1: Detection Efficiency

The ATLAS survey preferentially detects:

- Larger objects (brighter cross-section)
- More active objects (visible comae)
- Objects in favorable geometries

The ATLAS survey has a limiting magnitude of V ≈ 19.7, with detection efficiency dropping sharply near this limit (15). Recent work debiasing the ATLAS NEO population shows that detection efficiency is a strong function of apparent magnitude, with substantial incompleteness for fainter objects and additional losses for fast-moving objects due to trailing (15).

For interstellar objects, which move rapidly across the sky and are often near the detection limit, detection efficiency for sub-km ISOs is conservatively estimated at ~5–20% of the efficiency for the brightest, most active kilometer-scale objects like 3I/ATLAS. This means we detect only 1 in 5 to 1 in 20 similar objects.

**Correction factor: 5–20× fewer objects needed**

### Correction #2: Survey Duration — The 25-Year Baseline

Loeb's calculation assumes ATLAS has been surveying for 5 years. But this ignores the broader context of asteroid surveys.

The reality: Dedicated all-sky surveys capable of detecting interstellar objects have been operational since the late 1990s:

- LINEAR (1998-present)
- Spacewatch (1980s-present, significantly upgraded in 1990s)
- Catalina Sky Survey (2004-present)
- Teide Observatory Tenerife Asteroid Survey (2009-)
- Pan-STARRS (2010-, detected 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017)
- ATLAS (2017-, detected 3I/ATLAS in 2025)

These surveys have collectively scanned the skies for over 25 years before detecting 3I/ATLAS in 2025.

Using 5 years instead of 25 years is denominator bias at its finest — cherry-picking the shortest possible timeframe while ignoring decades of "null results" from equally or even more capable surveys.

**Correction factor: 25/5 = 5× fewer objects needed**

### Putting It Together

Loeb's claim: 10²³ objects requiring 10 Earth masses processed per star

- Correction #1 — Detection efficiency (5–20%): 5–20× fewer objects
- Correction #2 — Survey duration (25 years, not 5): 5× fewer objects

**Combined correction: 25–100× overestimate**

### The Reasonable Natural Population

Instead of 10 Earth masses per star, we need:

- Best case (100× correction): 10 / 100 = 0.1 Earth masses per star
- Conservative case (25× correction): 10 / 25 = 0.4 Earth masses per star

### Is This Achievable?

Absolutely. During Solar System formation:

- Total material processed: 30–100 Earth masses (24)
- Standard ejection rate: 10–30% of planetesimals (18)
- Expected ejected mass: 3–30 Earth masses

We need 0.1–0.4 Earth masses — that's only 1–10% of what gets naturally ejected during planet formation.

No miracles required. No exotic processes. Just standard, messy, inefficient planetary system formation doing what it always does.

Important caveat: These estimates rely on Solar System observations as our baseline. Other planetary systems may differ, but the Solar System is our only local laboratory for these processes. May another 3I/ATLAS be discovered in the next 5–10 years, we will need to revise our knowledge base.

### Could Cataclysmic Events Change This?

Potentially. Our estimate assumes "steady-state" ejection. But several processes could produce bursts:

- Planetary migration/instabilities: The Nice Model suggests our giant planets underwent orbital instability ~3.9 Ga, ejecting Kuiper Belt material (26)
- Close stellar encounters: Passing stars can perturb outer systems (27)
- Binary disruption: Wide binaries that get disrupted scatter planetary material (28)

However, even accounting for episodic events, the time-averaged mass budget of 0.1–0.4 Earth masses per star remains well within natural planetary system formation.

## The Pattern: Statistical Manipulation

Loeb's treatment of 3I/ATLAS reveals a pattern:

**Size estimates that keep changing:**

- July 2025: 1 km prediction (20)
- September 2025: 15 km "profound size paradox" (21)
- November 2025: 5–10 km revision (22)
- December 2025: Back to ~1 km (23)

This is normal. It is how science works. New, hopefully better, data makes us update knowledge, hypothesis and refine the numbers. This is science. Nothing else. What is not science comes now:

- Through all this: The claim "10²³ objects" population estimate never changed.
- Survey duration: Uses 5 years, ignoring 25+ years of capable surveys that found nothing until 2025.

At each stage, whichever parameter made the object seem most anomalous was emphasized. When one anomaly got explained, focus shifted to another — trajectory, anti-tail, spectroscopic features.

This is Uri Geller's spoon-bending technique applied to astronomy:

1. Focus attention on one dramatic claim
2. When that's debunked, shift to a different anomaly
3. Ignore detection biases that every other field accounts for
4. Present a false binary: "absurd natural population OR aliens"
5. Never acknowledge when contradictory claims undermine each other

Uri Geller and his kind are among the most dangerous individuals for our society, exploiting the lack of critical thinking education we unfortunately live with. However, Geller-style tricks performed by scientists are even more dangerous, since they are claimed from the highest possible pedestal, hiding behind the authority of an academic position. But science is not authority. It is a method, not a title.

As someone wisely said recently, "science is the humility to seek questions and learn from nature without the arrogance of expertise." May I humbly add: Science is also the humility to accept being mistaken when data demonstrates it. Using statistics to obscure mistakes rather than reveal truth brings science into the realm of pseudoscience.

## Conclusion: The Real Absurdity

When you do the statistics honestly, with proper detection bias corrections and realistic survey timelines, 3I/ATLAS requires a completely reasonable natural population.

Does this mean the end of the story? Of course not! 3I/ATLAS is a most interesting objects that deserves maximal attention as far as our telescopes can reach it. It is bringing us clues from a place we will never be able to experiment first hand. It has already given us very interesting data that defy our comet understanding. We shall keep studying it.

The only thing truly absurd is claiming that:

- 2 detections in 8 years implies millions of civilizations launching probes
- That produce no radio signals
- Leave no other evidence of their existence beyond molecular signatures (HCN, CO, C₂, C₃, Fe, Ni, CN, COOH₃) identical to natural comets
- But conveniently look exactly like comets in every measurable way

Loeb wants to force a choice: accept "10 Earth masses processed per star" or accept alien technology.

The reality: With proper bias corrections, it's 0.1–0.4 Earth masses per star. Completely consistent with what we know about planetary system formation. Our own Solar System is thought to processed 30–100 Earth masses during formation (24), ejecting 10–30% as it built planets.

The ratio: 0.1–0.4 vs 10 = 25–100× less material than Loeb claims.

For 2026, I can only ask that every high school in the world shine light into the darkness of pseudoscience by encouraging our new generations to read critical thinking works such as Carl Sagan's "The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark."

In that prescient book, written in 1995, Sagan warned:

> "I have a foreboding of an America in my children's or grandchildren's time — when the United States is a service and information economy; when nearly all the key manufacturing industries have slipped away to other countries; when awesome technological powers are in the hands of a very few, and no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues; when the people have lost the ability to set their own agendas or knowledgeably question those in authority; when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in decline, unable to distinguish between what feels good and what's true, we slide, almost without noticing, back into superstition and darkness…"

Today, more than ever, we must embrace critical thinking to avoid perishing in the realm of pseudoscience. A realm that has been boosted exponentially by our hyper-connected world and the advent of AI. When interstellar comets can be transformed into alien probes through statistical sleight of hand, when spoon-bending tricks can be performed with equations instead of cutlery, we desperately need the candle of science to illuminate the darkness.
