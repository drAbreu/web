A new year brings always a spark of hope to our lives.

This might, however, not be the case for those of us suffering from panic and anxiety. And for you, if you are battling and see no end to this suffering, I want to bring hope.
Even most importantly, I do want to bring a new, more constructive and warming way to see panic and anxiety: self-eficacy.

For over five years now I have been battling with both of these formidable frenemies. While everyone was fighting a world pandemy, they came to me as my personal one. 
During a bike training they attacked remorseless, leading me to a start process of seeking medical help every single week to ensure that my heart was not failing.
I would stop getting the bike at first. I would stop going out to avoid those fear sensations. They chased me on my dreams, even during intimate moments.
Weeks after, not even the walls of my apartment were enough to keep those specters away.

The symptoms I suffered began to remit and let me regain my life and confidence only after I started cognitive-conductual therapy, backed by science as the most successful therapy against these disorders [1,2,3]. On a nutshell, the goal of this therapy is fear extinction. During our fear avoidance phases, such as mine own described above, we generate the so-called "fear memory", that re-writes our brain in becomming over reactant to otherwise normal situations [4]. We must therefore re-write those connections, and there is only one way to do so. The golden rule is: 

"Is there anything you don't want to do due to fear? Then... DO IT!"

Obviously, this seem impossible. How could I face any of my fears where my existence was ironhandedly ruled by fear itself? The epiphany moment when I finally began to address those fears and I resume to use behavioral therapy came by reading Hyperion, from Dan Simmons, when an alien parasit implanted on Paul Dure's chest had the following effect:

> Esta cosa solo busca evitar la muerte sin razonamiento alguno, por cualquier medio. Yo no deseo morir, pero prefiero aceptar el dolor y la muerte antes que una eternidad de existencia vacía 

This sentence encapsulates dramaticallty a life with anxiety and the way out of it. We long at home for brighter futures when fears will go away and we will be our previous selves again, but only facing those fears will be the shooting star making our wishes reality

Cognitive therapy is a way of living. A life-transforming journey. A journey without end, that we must embrace to keep our anxiety and fears dominated. Note I say dominated and not away. This is because anxiety and fear are part of ourselves, as it is an evolutionary response from our anestors [5]. Only their overreaction is pathological. We need to train our brain to accept them in the right moments but to dismiss their false alarms when it has to. This is the core of cognitive therapy. It is called neuroplasticity [6]. We search our fears over and over again to show our brain that those situations are mundane. That no alarms should be sent. And as our brains learns this, it re-writes the internal wirings leaving us new.

And here is where the message of hope I want to bring for this new year comes.

Comductual-cognitive therapy offers an entire transformation of our brain and it offers, as drugs do, secondary effects. however, unlike drugs, these secondary effects are extremely positive and valuable for our future selves. Research shows that people that successfully goes through this therapy, thanks to their constant exposition to their deepest fears, develope a state of self-confidence, known als self-eficacy, that shapes completely their future livees [7,8,9]. They get much more confident people. They are able to see problems from a much more relative way, surely a less terribilizing approach comes. People see their lives much more full and colourful they did before. 

Doesn't it sound great?

It is not only that you get rid of your fears and recover yourself. You transform into a much better version of you. Less troubled, happier with life.

There is a beautiful word in German without, I think, direct translation to English: Morgenrot. Literally the "Morning red", it stays for those warm caleidoscopic colors that appear on the east heralding a new beginning. Warm vissions that come when you most need them. At the coldest and darkest of night, when all hope seemed vanished. New year is a new Morgenrot. A moment of resolutions. And if you are feeling anxiety and panic, your resolution must be focus on facing them. Not on sending them away, but on converting them into your friends. 

Expose to your fears, no matter how hard they are, and you'll see recompenses. 

Record every single exposure. Every single succes. Minor as it may seem. For that will show you that you are comming out. That will strength your will when it may weak. Anxiety and panic dominated minds focus very selectively on bad memories [10,11,12], so add every good memory, every laugh, every fear conquered, every moment of love to that list. You will have on it the testament to move forward. 

And when a new year comes, you will realized how strong you were. How you are improving your live. And your self-eficacy will come and hold your hand into a new life. 

A life, a permanent Morgenrot on its own, full of hope and warm feelings.
