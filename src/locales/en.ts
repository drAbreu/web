      title: "Professional Biography",
      content: `Dr. Jorge Abreu-Vicente is an accomplished researcher bridging the fields of astrophysics and data science. Currently working at EMBO (European Molecular Biology Organization), he specializes in applying artificial intelligence and machine learning to biomedical research.

His academic journey began with a PhD cum laude from the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy and the University of Heidelberg, where he conducted groundbreaking research on molecular cloud structure and star formation mechanisms at galactic scales. This work combined large-scale computational simulations with observational data analysis, laying the foundation for his expertise in handling complex, multi-dimensional datasets.

Transitioning from astrophysics to biomedicine, Dr. Abreu-Vicente now focuses on developing AI-powered tools for scientific research. He has contributed to several high-impact projects including BioChatter, a platform for biomedical applications of large language models published in Nature Biotechnology, and SourceDataNLP, a natural language processing pipeline for automated knowledge extraction from scientific literature.

His work emphasizes open science, reproducible research, and the democratization of AI tools for the scientific community. He actively contributes to building knowledge graphs and semantic tools that help researchers navigate the ever-growing landscape of biomedical literature.

Beyond his technical work, Dr. Abreu-Vicente is passionate about mental health advocacy. He authored "Morgenrot," a science-backed personal narrative about overcoming panic attacks and anxiety, helping others through lived experience and evidence-based approaches.

With a unique perspective that spans from cosmic phenomena to molecular biology, Dr. Abreu-Vicente continues to push the boundaries of what's possible when combining domain expertise with cutting-edge technology.`,

EVERY HEARTBEAT COULD BE THE LAST. —roared Gríma, making every nerve in my body vibrate.\n\nMy heart rate skyrocketed in seconds! 120, 130, 140, 150, 160… I could only make a phone call under the emotional certainty that the next few minutes would be critical to save my life.",

It's as if our internal alarm system has become hyperactive and now sees threats where there are only normal sensations. It confuses an open water tap with a tsunami, a firecracker with a long-range missile.\n\nThe good news is that if your brain learned to fear those sensations, it can also learn not to fear them. If you fell into this trap following a specific process, you can get out of it by following the reverse process.",

We're risking our lives! —shouted Gríma.\n\n—Enough nonsense!

Erratic movements, intense palpitations, stabbing chest pain, numb hands…\n\nHowever, as I contemplated the course of the Miño River, something extraordinary happened: the anxiety gradually subsided, giving way to a clear mind.
