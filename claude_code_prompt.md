We are going to build and AWESOME personal site using React.js.

In the attached image you can see the logo of our webpage, which is called: DATAST*R, by Jorge Abreu-Vicente, PhD

The domain will be datastar.space, and the page will be hosted in github pages. 

The requirements of the webpage is that:

* Must be perfectly translated in English and Spanish
* It will have a blog with comments (I know this is not directly accessible in github since github has static pages, but there are existing workarounds that we could implement. Keep it free)
* Same as above, but allowing visitors to subscribe for a news letter service. 
* The morgenrot part of the page will have its own `morgenrot.datastar.space` domain since it will be a page for the book
* There are two brands. Datastar as a whole and there will be a morgenrot brand. For now, keep it the same as for the rest, but eventually morgenrot will have its own logo and colors. This is because the topic is psychology and will have more good feeling collor pallettes and images than the technical part.
* The technical part will be about astronomy, AI, ML, Science, and biology

You can see the site map that I do want you to build in the attached images.

**MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ACCESS TO THE TOOLS OF browsermcp**

Please use browsermcp to navigate and understand the webpage: Use the MCP Browser to explore @https://liamvanvliet.com/
Break down the site's core architecture, focusing on navigation flow, component structure, routing strategy, state management, styling methodology, and interactive behaviors.
Pay close attention to technical patterns hierarchy with the goal of creating an accurate and scalable clone . Then build the clone as a next js app.

This will be the core of our webpage. Please check it and we will make it ours using the collor pallete of our logos and our Site map and topics. The sitemap exported to react.js you can find in the `sitemap-schema` folder. This will help you to guide yourself through the proposed initial webpage and to translate it into ours. 

If you would find an issue with an image, please tell me what the issue is about

As special, for the CV / Resumee page, I want you to use also the browser mcp to check @https://brittanychiang.com/ I think that is a very elegant way of showing the CV / Resumee on a technical way.

For now, I want you to build the UI. Use placeholders to build it. We will first focus on building a beautiful UI and we will later add the content. 

For the social media icons:

linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/abreujorge-dataresearch/
goodreads: https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/146420427-jorge-abreu-vicente
medium: https://medium.com/@datastar
github: https://github.com/drAbreu
youtube: [keep_empty_but leave the icon]

Remember, build two different style files, naming both style_tech and style_morgenrot. Keep them the same for now, but associate to morgenrot and all the morgenrot tagged posts theirs and the other to all the rest.

I think this is enough to prepare a first working personal page using react for github pages
