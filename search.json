    "text": "Welcome!\nThis is the personal blog of Dr. Jorge Abreu Vicente. I see the blog as a window to communicate with you, not as a tool to only share my work. As such, this blog will have different topics on it. From the wonders of the cosmos in Astronomy, to the ultimate wonder of the cosmos: life itself. But it will not be only about Astronomy and Biology. I will bring machine learning, coding, and AI too since they are my current working tools. During the winter season I will bring the observation diary of a backyard amateur astronomer. And the content of the blog will also be filled with other topics such as opinions or career advice.\nI hope you like this space and please, make sure to share your thoughs.\nBest! ! !\nJorge\nCheck this link for details on the listings page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

After five successful years as a Data Science and AI consultant in industry, I embraced the path back to my beloved scientific research at the European Molecular Biology Organization, EMBO and European Life Sciences Laboratory, EMBL as a Machine Learning and AI Developer. I do cutting-edge research focusing on natural language processing (NLP), large language models (LLMs), multi-modal learning, and the generation and analysis of knowledge graphs. My scientific field of interest is primary molecular and cell biology, although I ocasionally look back to the application of the developed techniques to astronomy.\nI am part of the EMBO Open Science Implementation Group, led by Dr. Thomas Lemberger. Our goal is to revolutionize scientific research by promoting open science tools and methodologies, helping researchers to fill the knowledge gap generated by the current huge scientific productivity. We stand for transparent and accessible research, aiming for a more collaborative and innovative research landscape.\nHaving shifted my focus from astronomy to the biomedical field, I seek to contribute unraveling the mysteries of life. My career has shifted from understanding the universe to, with my expertise in AI, understanding the ultimate wonder of our cosmos: life itself. This transition reflects my insatiable curiosity and dedication to making transformative discoveries in the pursuit of advancing human knowledge.\nMy publications list is available at ORCID and at NASA ADS abstract service."
