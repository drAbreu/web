1. Why do we need NEL
    - Summary of the situation
    - Summary of Biomedical NEL for Proteins and their quality
    - Possible new approaches to be taken to improve
    - Use a summarization of the paper from David here? 
    - Why to use RAG to improve the situation

2. Embed uniprot using SBERT or any of the best embedders available and check how good it is
    -> Use a mix between keywords (text of the entity) and the embeddings (Fusion retrieval / hybrid search, reciprocal rank fusion)

3. Generating a very specific model (SPROUT)
    -> Because we will use Figure captions, we need to use this as embeddings
    -> We will get Abstract vs Fig Captions
    -> Generate contrastive learning approach using the abstract of the paper referenced for a given function
        - How to get the negative samples is a question 
        - I need to generate a database of all the papers and maybe have a similarity matrix or something like that
        - To be seen but very important 

4. Embedding SPROUT into a vector indexer

5. Using Langchain to do check how good SPROUT does compared to the previous non-finetuned embedding

6. Use the best embedder and generate agents to do the work

7. Results and summary
