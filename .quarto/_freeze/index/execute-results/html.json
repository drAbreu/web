After five successful years as a Data Science and AI consultant in industry, I embraced the path back to my beloved scientific research at the [European Molecular Biology Organization, EMBO](https://www.embo.org/) and [European Life Sciences Laboratory, EMBL](https://www.embl.org/sites/heidelberg/) as a Machine Learning and AI Developer. <font color=#df6919><strong>I do cutting-edge research focusing on natural language processing (NLP), large language models (LLMs), multi-modal learning, and the generation and analysis of knowledge graphs. My scientific field of interest is primary molecular and cell biology</strong></font>, although I ocasionally look back to the application of the developed techniques to astronomy.\n\nI am part of the [*EMBO Open Science Implementation Group*](https://www.embo.org/policy/open-science/), led by Dr. Thomas Lemberger. <font color=#df6919><strong>Our goal is to revolutionize scientific research by promoting open science tools and methodologies, helping researchers to fill the knowledge gap generated by the current huge scientific productivity.</strong></font> <font color=#4c9be8><strong>We stand for transparent and accessible research, aiming for a more collaborative and innovative research landscape.</strong></font> \n\nHaving shifted my focus from astronomy to the biomedical field, I seek to contribute unraveling the mysteries of life. <font color=#4c9be8><strong>My career has shifted from understanding the universe to, with my expertise in AI, understanding the ultimate wonder of our cosmos: life itself</strong></font>. This transition reflects my insatiable curiosity and dedication to making transformative discoveries in the pursuit of advancing human knowledge.\n\nMy publications list is available at [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0211-6416) and at [NASA ADS abstract service](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=author%3A%22Abreu-Vicente%2C%20J.%22&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0).\n\n",
